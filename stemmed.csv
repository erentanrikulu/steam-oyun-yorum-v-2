STILL does not launch properly and freezes at launch OR otherwise the gameplay freezes every 10 seconds. I got this game on cdkeys so I can't even get a refund either. Simply amazing.I also submitted a ticket on the Focus website and they responded to my ticket saying that they are investigating these issues still but no fix at this time and they did not provide any ETA.I'm no longer wasting my time trying to find a fix. I have almost 2000 games on steam and this is the only one that is having this issue. It's not an issue with my system. This game is very clearly the issue and I highly suggest anyone else experiencing similar issues to report this game as broken on steam.Original review:Game won't even launch. I have a nvidia 3090 gpu, AMD 5950x cpu, 128gb ddr4 ram, m.2 ssd for boot and the game is installed on a separate m.2. When I launch the game it pops up with the anticheat screen loading. After that it goes full screen just black and says not responding. No amount of troubleshooting I seem to do fixes it. I can't even get to the main menu.Figured out to get it to launch literally just click launch from steam and WAIT and eventually it will load. DO NOT CLICK ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL IT LOADS.The default setting when the game starts is set to UNLIMITED FRAME RATE. Like good lord my computer was pushing 240fps in 1440p my computer was just an absolute space heater until I locked the framerate to 60.Even after turning unlimited framerate off I realized simply the act of LAUNCHING THE GAME pushes my GPU and CPU so incredibly hard that both temperatures will reach around 90 celsius almost instantly.When I am able to start the actual campaign the gameplay freezes literally almost 10 seconds. It is like a 50% chance of it crashing whenever it freezes otherwise it just freezes every 10 seconds.Also sometimes the mission gameplay will get sent into a loading screen saying ""disconnected"" and ""changing host"" and will just send you back to the beginning of the mission. Absolutely ridiculous.Turned everything to lowest settings, vsync off. Even changed display setting to 1920x1080p and being in the main menu or in the mission runs my CPU/GPU up to 90 celsius almost instantly. My conclusion right now is that it's terrifying to run this game because of how insanely hard this game appears to be pushing my system even when all settings are turned down/off and I believe that the game is breaking because of something like that. Besides that I also think the servers are not built for the magnitude and are just bogged down right now too.Ain't it something that everyone here paid 80-100 bucks for this just for it to be completely unplayable for half the community.",game game game game offici releas date still game game game game game game game game game game game unplay still launch properli freez launch otherwis gameplay freez everi second got game cdkey cant even get refund either simpli amazingi also submit ticket focu websit respond ticket say investig issu still fix time provid etaim longer wast time tri find fix almost game steam one issu issu system game clearli issu highli suggest anyon els experienc similar issu report game broken steamorigin reviewgam wont even launch nvidia gpu amd cpu ram ssd boot game instal separ launch game pop anticheat screen load goe full screen black say respond amount troubleshoot seem fix cant even get main menufigur get launch liter click launch steam wait eventu load click anyth els loadsth default set game start set unlimit frame rate like good lord comput push comput absolut space heater lock framer turn unlimit framer realiz simpli act launch game push gpu cpu incred hard temperatur reach around celsiu almost instantlywhen abl start actual campaign gameplay freez liter almost second like chanc crash whenev freez otherwis freez everi secondsalso sometim mission gameplay get sent load screen say disconnect chang host send back begin mission absolut ridiculousturn everyth lowest set vsync even chang display set main menu mission run cpugpu celsiu almost instantli conclus right terrifi run game insan hard game appear push system even set turn downoff believ game break someth like besid also think server built magnitud bog right tooaint someth everyon paid buck complet unplay half commun

"2018 This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors....",extrem hardcor skillbas firstperson shooter forc think differ modern shooter your call duti player your go need chang play style succeed hereglob offens definit counterstrik sequel look feel familiar minor tweak help balanc old issu surpris longtim player demand skillbas multiplay game that satisfi ever specif kind player your will learn play differ your use look elsewher otherwis toptier tactic game probabl share longtail legaci predecessor
"2022 Dark Souls IIII with jump button and open world Elden Ring is an evolution of established design trends of From Software studio. ER follows the same gameplay formula as Dark Souls 3 with few new added mechanics that don't fundamentally change the gameplay. As a game it's derivative of its predecessors, the new elements rather than changing formula, feel like continuation of it. Open world Out of the all new elements, the open world aspect of the game is best realised. Instead of following usual practise of separating open-world activities and game progression. ER links game progression with exploration and makes its focus. At it's design core it follows principles of thoughtful minimalism and focus. Those combined together create a game world, in which player can navigate without utilising map. Instead player is visually lead and drawn to nearest objective or interesting places. What's impressive is that almost all major locations are visible from a distance, which helps to point player in right direction. The sheer scale and verticality of those location is spectacular. Instead of using elaborate illusions to make huge location like in previous games. ER aims to make its location fully explorable and massive at the same time. Addition of jumping button also allowed for more interesting and intricate level design. Royal Capital Leyndell is the pinnacle of this design - the biggest location in FROM games. Imagine Anor Londo or Yarhnam, but you can explore everything you see. With open world, ER also introduces an element of nonlinearity to the formula, which after Bloodborne became increasingly linear. This nonlinearity allows for greater build variety and gameplay freedom, player can beat almost any boss he wants in order he wants and pursue different rewards as a result. However, with this approach some corners had to be cut and as a result game reuses many assets and isn't as neatly balanced as previous titles.Crafting fits suprisingly well into gameplay loop. Not only it rewards exploration and incentives seeking new cookbooks, but most importantly it gives immadiate access to neccesary consumables without the need to farm them from the enemies as most of crafting resources are plenty and abundant in game world. Furthermore, this system is entirely optional, as crafting isn't tied to character progression and crafting selection is only limited to consumables and projectiles like arrows or knives. Not to mention many of said items are also sold by merchants and found on corpses. Combat ER builds upon and expands on DS 3 combat template. Most of major enemies and bosses follow the same design principles as DS3 enemies with thier delayed attacks and agressive combos. ER goes even further with this by making bosses even more agressive with more delayed attacks and smaller opening windows, some of them even adjust thier attack strings and behaviour to player inputs and position. This puts even more emphasis on evasion and swift attacks. In turn, this makes boss fights even more dynamic and engaging by forcing player to take risk and carfully find opportunities to strike instead of just waiting for a boss to finish his attacks. Furthermore, bosses have been specifically designed to punish the old habits of veteran souls players and to force them to adapt and change thier strategies to overcame the challenge. I feel like addition of summon ashes has negative impact on the game's balance. The enhanced enemy agression and input reading can be in-part explained as way to combat trivializing aspect of this system. As a result, I feel some of the battles were design and balanced with summon ashes in-mind, especially Crucible knights duo. Edit: they fixed this in issue in patch 1.04 by decreasing bosses aggression when they're in group and most obnoxious cases of input reading have been removed since. Summon ashes still are an easy mode, but now the game doesn't corner you to use it as much as before.Ashes of war system is great. It allows player to change weapon arts of armaments and thier scalling at the site of grace. it highly encourages experimentation and weapon switching. Amazing addition that creates even more build variety. Horse combat is entirely uninteresting and becomes dull very quickly. Fortunately, game rarely if ever forces player to fight on horse and majority of open-world bosses can be fought on foot. I think that Torrent was only added as means of transport and combat was just an afterthought. Conclusion Overall, Dark souls IV Elden Ring is natural conclusion of all previous FROM games. Fundamentally, It's just bigger and better than Bloodborne and Darksouls 3. However, this over adherence to already established formula hinders and restrains the studio's creative potential. I don't think they can follow same forumla endlessly. While ER is a great game, I wish they would experiment more with thier games, as it is they are starting to eat thier own tail.Finally, the most importantly I want Sellen to sit on my face",dark soul iiii jump button open world elden ring evolut establish design trend softwar studio er follow gameplay formula dark soul new ad mechan dont fundament chang gameplay game deriv predecessor new element rather chang formula feel like continu open world new element open world aspect game best realis instead follow usual practis separ openworld activ game progress er link game progress explor make focu design core follow principl thought minim focu combin togeth creat game world player navig without utilis map instead player visual lead drawn nearest object interest place what impress almost major locat visibl distanc help point player right direct sheer scale vertic locat spectacular instead use elabor illus make huge locat like previou game er aim make locat fulli explor massiv time addit jump button also allow interest intric level design royal capit leyndel pinnacl design biggest locat game imagin anor londo yarhnam explor everyth see open world er also introduc element nonlinear formula bloodborn becam increasingli linear nonlinear allow greater build varieti gameplay freedom player beat almost boss want order want pursu differ reward result howev approach corner cut result game reus mani asset isnt neatli balanc previou titlescraft fit suprisingli well gameplay loop reward explor incent seek new cookbook importantli give immadi access neccesari consum without need farm enemi craft resourc plenti abund game world furthermor system entir option craft isnt tie charact progress craft select limit consum projectil like arrow knive mention mani said item also sold merchant found corps combat er build upon expand ds combat templat major enemi boss follow design principl enemi thier delay attack agress combo er goe even make boss even agress delay attack smaller open window even adjust thier attack string behaviour player input posit put even emphasi evas swift attack turn make boss fight even dynam engag forc player take risk car find opportun strike instead wait boss finish attack furthermor boss specif design punish old habit veteran soul player forc adapt chang thier strategi overcam challeng feel like addit summon ash neg impact game balanc enhanc enemi agress input read inpart explain way combat trivial aspect system result feel battl design balanc summon ash inmind especi crucibl knight duo edit fix issu patch decreas boss aggress theyr group obnoxi case input read remov sinc summon ash still easi mode game doesnt corner use much beforeash war system great allow player chang weapon art armament thier scall site grace highli encourag experiment weapon switch amaz addit creat even build varieti hors combat entir uninterest becom dull quickli fortun game rare ever forc player fight hors major openworld boss fought foot think torrent ad mean transport combat afterthought conclus overal dark soul iv elden ring natur conclus previou game fundament bigger better bloodborn darksoul howev adher alreadi establish formula hinder restrain studio creativ potenti dont think follow forumla endlessli er great game wish would experi thier game start eat thier tailfin importantli want sellen sit face

"TL DR: 9.2/10W:If you hold any curiosity in Chinese culture, tale of gods, the concept of ""Wu Kong"" that got abused by countless good/bad games, you should try this game. This game depict the best of the spirit ""Wu Kong"" and leave you with a tangled story for you to uncover, a good discussion of what is ""Wu Kong"".The next discussion should go to art, the art is amazing, probably the best Chinese companies have ever yield. The game play is also very fun, there are a large variety of different combination of spells to use, refund skill points are completely free. I had a great fun of thinking about builds for different bosses. This game's most similar comparison is God of War, it does a better job in a lot of aspects. you are constantly fighting mini-bosses and bosses with very little reuse of models. Character developments are amazing EXCEPT what I would discuss in the Ls.The story books tied to all normal mobs and bosses are fantastic too.English translation did a very good job, it conveys the majority of the idea of the hardest content to translate-- traditional Chinese.*** Next part contains a lot of spoilers***L:As the chosen one the you play the role of, ""you"" have limited character development, the game depict very little of your emotion, reaction to some most shocking, heart breaking, breathe taking events. other than collecting ***THE THINGS***(avoid spoiling here), you feel more like a vessel, even the real vessel feels more vivid (If you get to that fight, you will know what I mean).Quality of chapter 5 and 6 are questionable. Don't take me wrong, chapter 1 is a good starting, chapter 2, 3, 4 are amazing steady incrementing of difficulty and map puzzles, but chapter 5 feels short where you can't get to a lot of places where I think I should be able to go to and chapter 6 feels a rush to end.Camera on some bosses are aids, like really bad and annoying, some thin-leg bosses make that even worse.the hit-box on some boss registering feels not good.",tl dr hold curios chines cultur tale god concept wu kong got abus countless goodbad game tri game game depict best spirit wu kong leav tangl stori uncov good discuss wu kongth next discuss go art art amaz probabl best chines compani ever yield game play also fun larg varieti differ combin spell use refund skill point complet free great fun think build differ boss game similar comparison god war better job lot aspect constantli fight miniboss boss littl reus model charact develop amaz except would discuss lsthe stori book tie normal mob boss fantast tooenglish translat good job convey major idea hardest content translat tradit chines next part contain lot spoilersla chosen one play role limit charact develop game depict littl emot reaction shock heart break breath take event collect thingsavoid spoil feel like vessel even real vessel feel vivid get fight know meanqual chapter question dont take wrong chapter good start chapter amaz steadi increment difficulti map puzzl chapter feel short cant get lot place think abl go chapter feel rush endcamera boss aid like realli bad annoy thinleg boss make even worseth hitbox boss regist feel good

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

"2023 Elden Ring is a delicious late afternoon wine and cracker platter under a sweltering sun, cooled by a spring breeze and relaxing backyard music. The wine, the good of Elden Ring, it is intoxicating, addicting, aromatic and fruity, yet aged to perfection. The cracker, the difficulty, it is hard, rough, gritty and perhaps a little tough to bite through. Heck, some of the crackers on this platter are so stiff and unpalatable it could be hardtack. But there is no such crunch in Elden Ring, and these crackers, that cannot be overcome by lathering on a thick layer of cream cheese. How much cheese you apply to your cracker is up to you, but what you'll come to learn is that there is no right way to enjoy this wine. We all have our own idea of how much cheese we like. Some enjoy so much cheese that the cracker becomes obscured, perhaps there might as well not be any. Some enjoy their crackers dry, to compliment the complex blend of the wine as was intended.In either case, you will find how you like your game and enjoy it.",elden ring delici late afternoon wine cracker platter swelter sun cool spring breez relax backyard music wine good elden ring intox addict aromat fruiti yet age perfect cracker difficulti hard rough gritti perhap littl tough bite heck cracker platter stiff unpalat could hardtack crunch elden ring cracker overcom lather thick layer cream chees much chees appli cracker youll come learn right way enjoy wine idea much chees like enjoy much chees cracker becom obscur perhap might well enjoy cracker dri compliment complex blend wine intendedin either case find like game enjoy

Great game.EDIT: feb/11/2016 some wrong spelled words.EDIT: 23/NOV/2016this game has evolved a lot:constantly updates, some really bad updates like music kits, graffiti sprays just to get more money BUT there is some other excelent updates like hitbox fixes, animations, maps updates, etc.A great try to keep cheaters annoyed to cheat in MM, the new prime system is a good attempt to delay cheaters. and without doubt this system has reduced the cheaters in MM if you use your prime accountThe best eSport scene!

"This is the most fun game I've ever played, bar none. The varied battle system and rich storyline made me simply unable to stop. I think there is no better design than the fact that after failing, the things I gained before are still there. This will allow me to still get up after a boss failure and keep challenging, knowing that I trigger a new storyline.I've also played GTA5 before and that was a different feeling, all in all, I think WuKong is really good game!这是我玩过的最好玩的游戏，没有之一。多样的战斗系统和丰富的剧情，让我根本停不下来。我觉得最优秀的设计莫过于失败之后，我之前获得的东西依旧还在。这样会让我在BOSS失败后依旧可以站起来，不断的挑战，知道我触发新的剧情。我之前也玩过GTA5，那是另外一种感受，总之，我觉得悟空是真的不错的游戏！",fun game ive ever play bar none vari battl system rich storylin made simpli unabl stop think better design fact fail thing gain still allow still get boss failur keep challeng know trigger new storylin also play differ feel think wukong realli good

"2018 I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.However, due to insufficient capacity (private life) of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.

"2022 Elden ring is a masterpiece. There is no other word for it. The world design, boss fights, music, story and literally everything this game does is done perfectly. My enjoyment for the game hasn't been ruined by the performance problems because I haven't really ran into them other than when I first started up the game. I have an i5 9600k and a 1660 ti (which are both around the recommended specs) with all the settings at high with a couple like depth of field and motion blur turned a little bit down. I understand that the game has stuttering issues and frame rate problems but the true quality of the best game I have ever played and most likely will play for a very long time is hindered for anyone that looks at the steam store page and sees the mixed reviews.",elden ring masterpiec word world design boss fight music stori liter everyth game done perfectli enjoy game hasnt ruin perform problem havent realli ran first start game ti around recommend spec set high coupl like depth field motion blur turn littl bit understand game stutter issu frame rate problem true qualiti best game ever play like play long time hinder anyon look steam store page see mix review
"2022 The gameplay, race options, the prologue and the overall experience (strategic game) are fun and impressive. The game is beautiful and immersive. But, and it's a rage quit kind of but, you hit turn 30 of the chaos campaign and the mechanics kicks in and it all goes downhill. While the portals are exciting and some of the realm are fun and thematic, having other factions rush you at that time (preventing you from visiting them) and having the realm experience feel long and unfair (at least you can auto-resolve the last battle) drains the fun out of it. I finished it once, made it to the fourth soul before deciding it wasn't worth finishing on the 2nd playthrough and keep dropping out earlier and earlier on the other playthrough I've tried. Overall, I feel there's a really fun game underneath but that the campaign kills the enjoyment out of it. Having played the immortal empire campaign my review kinda stands : it feels ridiculously unbalanced from one faction to the next and, having tried many, I'm finding that it's a mix of fun and frustration. The base game fun is there but playing whack-a-mole on armies trashing your unprotectable smaller settlements, the sometimes stacked-against-you-against-logic of the AI and very uneven enjoyability of the different races and mechanics makes playing the game a frustrating experience.",gameplay race option prologu overal experi strateg game fun impress game beauti immers rage quit kind hit turn chao campaign mechan kick goe downhil portal excit realm fun themat faction rush time prevent visit realm experi feel long unfair least autoresolv last battl drain fun finish made fourth soul decid wasnt worth finish playthrough keep drop earlier earlier playthrough ive tri overal feel there realli fun game underneath campaign kill enjoy play immort empir campaign review kinda stand feel ridicul unbalanc one faction next tri mani im find mix fun frustrat base game fun play whackamol armi trash unprotect smaller settlement sometim stackedagainstyouagainstlog ai uneven enjoy differ race mechan make play game frustrat experi

"2022 I will be revisiting this review later, but 10 hours in and I'm having a great time. This is one of those few games that I can recommend at full price.EDIT: I have beaten the game, and have played for 75 hours. Time for a more comprehensive review.This game is a fantastic entry point into Souls for people who bounced off the series before, while still managing to be a top tier entry into the genre for those who were already on board (such as myself). The open world is expertly done, taking many lessons from Breath of the Wild and improving upon it with a better reward structure for exploration, tense encounters with many different types of adversaries, and a wide possibility of builds for your character to progress through the game with.The sense of discovery found in this game is near unmatched. Every major area feels unique in both visual aesthetic and gameplay requirements. Quite a lot of time and love went into making it a joy for players to stumble into areas that were much grander than initially perceived, and those moments just seem to keep coming. Like all Souls games, Elder Ring has its share of secrets areas and bosses that many people will never see, even after hitting the credits. While I encourage you to explore actively, I would also advise you to not look up those secrets until after you complete the game, and let your first adventure in the world be truly your own. Trust me, you will have plenty of resources without having to resort to any walkthrough.",revisit review later hour im great time one game recommend full priceedit beaten game play hour time comprehens reviewthi game fantast entri point soul peopl bounc seri still manag top tier entri genr alreadi board open world expertli done take mani lesson breath wild improv upon better reward structur explor tens encount mani differ type adversari wide possibl build charact progress game withth sens discoveri found game near unmatch everi major area feel uniqu visual aesthet gameplay requir quit lot time love went make joy player stumbl area much grander initi perceiv moment seem keep come like soul game elder ring share secret area boss mani peopl never see even hit credit encourag explor activ would also advis look secret complet game let first adventur world truli trust plenti resourc without resort walkthrough

"2017 Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better. Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues. Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route. Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire. Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team. If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort. Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet. Unlike other game types, Arms Race allows for respawns. It's the most chaotic and care-free mode in Global Offensive, with players throwing caution to the wind for the sake of climbing the kill ladder as quickly as possible. It's a shame there are only two maps in Arms Race -- a problem that will more likely persist on consoles than PC. If you have the option, playing the PC version is unquestionably the best way to experience Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Mods, mouse and keyboard, and the usual PC-only options are better than the ports. Plus, Valve is much better about long-term PC support -- it abandoned Team Fortress 2 on consoles, and Portal 2's level editor was PC exclusive. If you prefer to play on consoles, Global Offensive is the same great game",death great teacher failur counterstrik global offens alway seri greatest way learn gone shouldnt done could done better counterstrik player spend lot time learn consequ alway get better growth import factor global offens especi your come counterstrik fresh sabbat extrem hardcor skillbas firstperson shooter forc think differ modern shooter your call duti player your go need chang play style succeed counterstrik also tri develop someth new well despit littl push beyond alway done best global offens modifi old map keep veteran toe introduc offici new mode encourag differ play style first time almost year uniniti counterstrik global offens smallscal teambas firstperson shooter perman death counterterrorist kill terrorist plant explos classic defus match ct escort swallow sniper round hostag rescu victim dead good doesnt respawn next round player side must exercis skill care bomb object meanwhil give everyon purpos cours match end everyon team dead clever coordin terrorist team give ct slip plant bomb protect bomb site round everyon spend earn cash better gear gun cycl continu piec counterstrik formula date point superb heart soul global offens timeless team small gun lethal round short there addict justonemoreround qualiti there constant desir better last time earn satisfi kill win new way call duti battlefield vet wonder cant sprint escap enemi fire look iron sight improv aim counterstrik player feel like walk redecor home certain map redesign catch hardcor fan guard chang best underpass choke point dedust instanc new escap rout even face genr evolut global offens doesnt care adapt csgo dedic counterstrik age ideal despit market trend chang bruteforc way success part make engag competit game kill global offens requir wholli differ skill set shooter everyon limit see littl room charact modif onthefli advantag run gun useless play style even youv bought helmet kevlar round point someon stand still like score kill walk crouch stand best bet reduc inaccur spray machinegun fire consequ kill global offens feel good there sicken sensat drop someon dead know theyr come back also satisfi know use limit resourc play smarter victim player arent watch corner provid cover fire use smoke grenad flashbang theyr like take headshot delic patient triggerman desir experi distinct feel strong motiv keep play even your get steamrol obvious better team youv play counterstrik global offens probabl sound whole lot like counterstrik like counterstrik sourc global offens exist simpli modern look classic competit shooter littl disrupt core form function time enough color outsid line tradit justifi time effort fire one interest new combat variabl molotov cocktail incendiari grenad either roast group guy forc anoth direct flame use distract scare tactic theyr particularli use demolit match focu fight singl bomb site rather give terrorist two pick new modifi map mode arent big classic counterstrik arena entir section cut direct team toward central locat thought design intric ever lake map standout there wide open yet dens popul yard around bomb site insid sizabl lakesid home plenti vantag point hide spot separ demolit defus player cant buy round instead take cue new mode arm race kill unlock anoth weapon instantli better switch way play demolit fast youll need quick feet unlik game type arm race allow respawn chaotic carefre mode global offens player throw caution wind sake climb kill ladder quickli possibl shame two map arm race problem like persist consol pc option play pc version unquestion best way experi counterstrik global offens mod mous keyboard usual pconli option better port plu valv much better longterm pc support abandon team fortress consol portal level editor pc exclus prefer play consol global offens great game

"9 / 10 For me, this is one of the best games in history! This game is proof that a project doesn't need battle passes, paid cosmetics, or in-game shops to be successful. This is probably one of the most passionate games released in the past decade; the creativity and attention to detail are absolutely insane.Starting with one of the top selling points: the graphics. The graphics are absolutely absurd; Unreal Engine 5 is the best-looking engine on the market as of 2024, and this game makes very good use of it. Yes, using UE5 means that the game sometimes has some high optimization problems, although they're minor compared to other UE5 titles released recently.The combat and enemy variety in this game are simply absurd. Elden Ring is an amazing game, and even a game of that caliber still struggles to keep up with this game variety-wise. Every single enemy in this game is unique and original, with highly detailed models and movesets; there's only a very small amount of reused assets among the enemies and bosses. Some of the boss fights are creative enough to make your jaw drop. The game has a lot of different skills and movesets, transformations, and items to make the combat feel unique in each encounter. Although I gotta admit that I wish it had more spells.The biggest problem with this game compared to other action games is definitely the limitations on exploration of the map. This game has an absurd amount of invisible walls and limitations on the terrain blocking exploration, sometimes even on clear paths that look like they'd be explorable otherwise. And this is the reason i'm not giving this game a 10/10.The soundtrack fits very well with the theme of the game; the OSTs are magical and epic. Each chapter has an animation at the end with different art styles and music, with different stories and meanings. For a person who is not used to the main theme portrayed in this game, it's a magical experience for sure...I would definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in Chinese folklore and mythology. The story is amazing; I was totally unfamiliar with anything related to this theme, and after playing it, I gotta say I really want to know more about the general theme and meaning behind these stories.I genuinely believe this game will be remembered throughout the years as one of the most passionate and successful projects in gaming history.",one best game histori game proof project doesnt need battl pass paid cosmet ingam shop success probabl one passion game releas past decad creativ attent detail absolut insanestart one top sell point graphic graphic absolut absurd unreal engin bestlook engin market game make good use ye use mean game sometim high optim problem although theyr minor compar titl releas recentlyth combat enemi varieti game simpli absurd elden ring amaz game even game calib still struggl keep game varietywis everi singl enemi game uniqu origin highli detail model moveset there small amount reus asset among enemi boss boss fight creativ enough make jaw drop game lot differ skill moveset transform item make combat feel uniqu encount although got ta admit wish spellsth biggest problem game compar action game definit limit explor map game absurd amount invis wall limit terrain block explor sometim even clear path look like theyd explor otherwis reason im give game soundtrack fit well theme game ost magic epic chapter anim end differ art style music differ stori mean person use main theme portray game magic experi surei would definit recommend game anyon interest chines folklor mytholog stori amaz total unfamiliar anyth relat theme play got ta say realli want know gener theme mean behind storiesi genuin believ game rememb throughout year one passion success project game histori

"2022 Elden Ring reinvents the open world in the same way Breath of the Wild does. By breaking all the trends associated with modern open-world games. No hand-holding, no quest markers, no collectible-based progression, and no copy and pasted zones. You can explore any part of the world from the beginning, nothing (but a few tough enemies) is stopping you from exploring the farthest reaches of the world from the get-go. Build diversity is at an all-time high. With a plethora of play styles available, and with a generous ability to respec (around halfway through the game). I've played three wildly different characters, and each time I was able to make my idea come to life easily.Combat feels as fluent as ever. Strength weapons feel meaty and have a huge weight behind them. While dex-based weapons are fast and fluid. Int and Faith also shine with a huge arsenal of spells/incantations available to try.The only complaint I can levy against this incredible game is awful ultra-wide support and some choppy frame rates in certain areas of the game.",elden ring reinvent open world way breath wild break trend associ modern openworld game handhold quest marker collectiblebas progress copi past zone explor part world begin noth tough enemi stop explor farthest reach world getgo build divers alltim high plethora play style avail gener abil respec around halfway game ive play three wildli differ charact time abl make idea come life easilycombat feel fluent ever strength weapon feel meati huge weight behind dexbas weapon fast fluid int faith also shine huge arsen spellsincant avail tryth complaint levi incred game aw ultrawid support choppi frame rate certain area game

"I LOVE this game. I played the beta and played it during Next Fest. I love that there are so many different types of game genres that were touched on for the game. The negativity surrounding the game comes from a lot of people not willing to give it a chance and also those who don't want to take the time to learn the game. Also, any new game has long queue times for servers on launch day. Or do y'all not remember the fresh hell that was Destiny 2 launch? Just saying, give the game a chance, don't review bomb out the gate on a game you have not even truly played. That is not fair to the creators or the rest of the gaming community. To those looking to play, form your own opinions and don't listen to a bunch of negative Nancy's who played for 30 minutes and don't know what they are talking about.",love game play beta play next fest love mani differ type game genr touch game neg surround game come lot peopl will give chanc also dont want take time learn game also new game long queue time server launch day yall rememb fresh hell destini launch say give game chanc dont review bomb gate game even truli play fair creator rest game commun look play form opinion dont listen bunch neg nanci play minut dont know talk

"2022 Worse than TWW2 (current build) but better release than TWW2 release. I'm sure this will be awesome with a mortal empires/grand campaign added, in the future.Positives:-Many improvements to mechanics, diplomacy especially, saves soooo much time.-Allies are useful now, recruit allied units, coordinate and have fun -You can trade settlements!-Badass demon campaign mechanics, you are actually pretty powerful, and you feel it.-Great soundtracks, animations, landscapes and battle locations (except walled cities)Issues: -Some maps, like Altdorf are still missing textures.-Very poor end game reward, without spoilers.....very underwhelming for what it can do and what it comes with. Same reward for everyone, the narrative reward isn't granted, its just cutscenes and you don't get any new traits, abilities or anything.-Once you beat the campaign, have fun with never ending chaos invasions every 10 turns, forever. this requires you to have a hero stationed at each and every entry point, ready to close the portal for 1.5k gold, every 10 turns. if you want to take over the map, get ready to shell out tens of thousands of gold every 10 turns and bump up your hero cap.-The realms of chaos give little to no rewards. you really only go to slaanesh's penthouse to get fancy trinkets, the rest are trash, leaving you with bad traits.-No mortal empires yet-Walled cities hurt you, dont get them. Currently, when you try to dock archers on walls or whatever, their line of sight is often blocked and they just sit there, so you have to set archers behind walls or somewhere they can shoot from.-Adding walls to a settlement will place two capture points for your town/city, so instead of setting all your forces on top of an objective and defending, you have to split your force. Is it worth it to have 3 more units garrisoning your town but have to defend two capture points, which losing one loses the battle? NO, fight in the strees, no walls.",wors current build better releas releas im sure awesom mortal empiresgrand campaign ad futurepositivesmani improv mechan diplomaci especi save soooo much timeal use recruit alli unit coordin fun trade settlementsbadass demon campaign mechan actual pretti power feel itgreat soundtrack anim landscap battl locat except wall citiesissu map like altdorf still miss texturesveri poor end game reward without spoilersveri underwhelm come reward everyon narr reward isnt grant cutscen dont get new trait abil anythingonc beat campaign fun never end chao invas everi turn forev requir hero station everi entri point readi close portal gold everi turn want take map get readi shell ten thousand gold everi turn bump hero capth realm chao give littl reward realli go slaanesh penthous get fanci trinket rest trash leav bad traitsno mortal empir yetwal citi hurt dont get current tri dock archer wall whatev line sight often block sit set archer behind wall somewher shoot fromad wall settlement place two captur point townciti instead set forc top object defend split forc worth unit garrison town defend two captur point lose one lose battl fight stree wall

"Game is great but needs SERIOUS polishing on the network side of things. I'm one of those unfortunate souls who has been plagued with the inconsistent connection errors since day one. As in, after EVERY mission/op/session of ANY kind I am disconnected from the servers with no way of reconnecting. The only way to ""fix"" it is to ALT+F4 and restart the game. And you can't make progress offline (at least with ops) as it isn't saved. Would it be such a big deal to fix that if I wanted to solo some ops? I've had multiple runs where I would make it to the end of a mission and disconnect RIGHT before getting out. VERY disappointing. I've tried the PVP side of things as well and I can barely get through a match without getting a network error, and all my progress is lost. So what's the point? So that being said the game is GOOD enough to make me want to slog through this madness, but I'd wait until a patch releases that addresses these issues first before throwing down on it.",game great need seriou polish network side thing im one unfortun soul plagu inconsist connect error sinc day one everi missionopsess kind disconnect server way reconnect way fix restart game cant make progress offlin least op isnt save would big deal fix want solo op ive multipl run would make end mission disconnect right get disappoint ive tri pvp side thing well bare get match without get network error progress lost what point said game good enough make want slog mad id wait patch releas address issu first throw

"Reviewed in August 2024:Based on my PvE server experience probably the best Free-To-Play (and minimal PAY2WIN!) game out there.This is basically a post-apocalyptic survival shooter MMORPG where you must explore, build a home, find food and water, and kill some zombies and bizarre creatures. The variety of main quests and enemies are great, although most of them are copycat from other games and movies. The story, well... the dialogue sounds like google translated from Chinese to English which sometimes create corny moments (i skipped 80% of the cutscenes)You can complete the entire main quest solo, immersing yourself in hours of base building, exploration, and combat. However, playing with a group is even more enjoyable and beneficial, as you can share resources and support one another.Main quests take around 40-50 hours to complete, excluding side quests. In the endgame, depending on your specialization, you can farm crafting resources, prepare canned foods and drinks for stat buffs, craft tools, and sell them to others. Alternatively, you can focus become a dungeon warlord, taking on hard bosses and participating in Prime War—a 1-40 player PvE event against advanced bosses.Cons of this game:- Progress resets every 6 weeks, with only a few items being preserved while most are reset.- If the server is full, you won't be able to create a character to play with your friend. The developers have mentioned they plan to introduce a character server transfer option in the future.- Prime War can be a bit laggy, but new players don't need to worry since it's an optional objective.- So many bugs that i can't even list- Needs more optimization and performs poorly on HDD computers (I experience constant texture pop-ins)- Story is mediocre and has many questionable lore (who cares about story in multiplayer games though xD)My rating:80/100",review august pve server experi probabl best freetoplay minim game therethi basic postapocalypt surviv shooter mmorpg must explor build home find food water kill zombi bizarr creatur varieti main quest enemi great although copycat game movi stori well dialogu sound like googl translat chines english sometim creat corni moment skip cutscenesy complet entir main quest solo immers hour base build explor combat howev play group even enjoy benefici share resourc support one anothermain quest take around hour complet exclud side quest endgam depend special farm craft resourc prepar can food drink stat buff craft tool sell other altern focu becom dungeon warlord take hard boss particip prime wara player pve event advanc bossescon game progress reset everi week item preserv reset server full wont abl creat charact play friend develop mention plan introduc charact server transfer option futur prime war bit laggi new player dont need worri sinc option object mani bug cant even list need optim perform poorli hdd comput experi constant textur popin stori mediocr mani question lore care stori multiplay game though xdmi

I thought the game play was OK and I thought the graphics were pretty good and there were aspects to the combat that I kind of liked, but then after I get into the world and start playing around with the building, I noticed that you have to use the memetics to unlock all this ♥♥♥♥ to build a base and it's incredibly frustrating that i can't build simple things such as walls or doors without unlocking it in memetics first i can understand that for higher tier weapons and base equipment, but even though they're easy to unlock its the fact that I simply can't build basic things like that is dumb. Another thing that I don't like about the game is the fact that I am locked into one server. I am unable to create a new character and am forced to play this one server I selected.

"2022 CA hasn't regained my trust after the whole Shadows of Change and literally antagonizing their community fiasco (I won't go into detail, you can look it up yourself).Right now the game is in a much better spot but CA has a lot of work to do, they really need to bring back their release system back in Warhammer 2 where they release a DLC and an FLC. When I mean FLC, I mean a proper one not a single hero unit but a WHOLE FACTION with their own unique gameplay mechanics like Imrik for the High Elves.They did something right though with their DLCs currently in which you can now buy the specific DLC for the faction you want and are not force the buy the whole bundle for a massive price.Personally I recommend the game for anyone out there looking for a good Grand Strategy game where manage an empire in turn based system and fight battles RTS style. The game offers SO MANY interesting factions to play as (if you are willing to pay the extra dollar for the previous games and dlcs).Do note that even if you're just buying Warhammer 3 alone, you literally gain access to 10 different factions to play as: 3 Kislev Faction, 2 Cathay Factions, the 4 Chaos Factions and 1 Mixed Chaos Faction. In my opinion that gives players a lot to experience and with the Sandbox Campaign unlocked you can experience the whole of the Total War Warhammer game without having to buy the 2 previous games.I still cannot recommend buying this game at full price though as CA has not re-earned my trust for that.

"2020 This game will ruin any ambitions you have in real life. This game will consume all your energy, money and happiness. You might start as a casual player, enjoying the fun parts of the game. But the more you play, the more you descend into this pit of pure mental torture. This game will make even the most calm person into a raging toxic human being in some point of playing. The sheer toxicity this game causes even suppasses neurosis of the traditional road rage.You're better off hot railing meth than playing this godforsaken game.For every moment of fun and accomplishment you get 5 moments of desperation in this addicting hell hole.Now when it comes to skins. The marketing and hype for skins is absolutely incredible. Valve did a good job creating a platform, where having expensive items that do jack'all is considered that of a higher social status, somehow similar to buying expensive branded clothes. Of course a lot of people don't care about skins. But let me tell you. Once you start getting into the game more. You start seeing yourself improving as you go on. And you will absolutely spend money on skins rather than buying a new game or something different on steam. It's an ego trap. Everyone thinks they are on a road to becoming the best player, which gives them a justification for spending money on useless ♥♥♥♥, and for the more mentaly unstable individuals... Gamble with those items, so that they get stuck in this loop of wanting to return to their base value by gambling more. Creating gambling addicts disguised as videogame players- What is even more damaging, is the fact that valve doesn't enforce the ratings of their games, even to the extent of microtransactions.

"2022 Edit: The most recent update is certainly a step in the right direction. Anti-player bias was reduced and a lot of big issues such as replenishment was improved for some factions. Whoever is now managing the project seem to be more receptive/involved with the community. I'll keep this as negative still for now but its FINALLY improving the way people asked.Edit#2: Game has fixed most of its launch issues now. A few lay around waiting to ambush you at annoying moments but overall, it's a far better game now. I'm leaving the review up as I personally am very exhausted of total war games coming out with horrific balance and would like this to serve as a reminder. If this game came out in the state it is now in, it would be a big thumbs up.Ooof where to start? The fact that it wasn't ready? The fact that they doubled down on things people hated in the other games? The freakishly slow updates to get some of the most basic issues fixed? The fact a warhammer game needs almost an entire year to get blood added?... a warhammer game, where you can play as the blood god. The fact the main campaign is an absolute miserable experience? There's just.. so much more. I'll start with the positives.The main positive I could give is that factions have much more engaging mechanics to them than earlier games. Even if their rosters are miserably small... no we're trying to say something nice here. Ogres feel actually finished as a roster, with interesting mechanics and a wide variety of units.The bad.. well it's difficult to explain how extremely bad some of these things are with a character limit so short. I could write multiple pages about the design flaws in the main campaign. Flaws ranging from complex issues that are difficult to deal with to amateur design choices that you'd imagine get thrown out the first time they slip from anyone's lips let alone added to a 60$ AAA title.The campaign is effectively a race, which gets triggered every 20-30 turns. Unfortunately, this absolutely kills the pacing of the base Total War gameplay. Everything comes to a halt, as you enter Chaos realms to get a soul first. Only to realiize that you are the only one playing this game. The AI is not playing the same game as you at all. They do not have the same challenges, they do not get the same debuffs, they do not have to complete the same puzzles, they do not need buildings to recruit units, they do not need to actually do anything you do. They just automatically breeze through while you suffer the most miserable experiences of endless debuffs and being attacked by other enemies while your main army is in some pocket dimension. The game actively punishes you for playing the game as intended. Expanding your settlements and empire means the AI will disproportionately focus you. Allowing their own home to be burned down with no reaction, while sending 3 armies to your doorstep. Maybe get allies? They could be useful if there wasn't an in game design that makes any AI who you alliance with, suddenly become the most passive and weak faction. Yes, if you alliance with an AI, they actually get their AI debuffed to not do anything by themselves. The AI is just so obviously AI due to its comical level of player targeting bias. Shamelessly doing anything it can to stop you while doing nothing else the entire game. An issue so bad, even the developers have had to admit it needs fixing. Just keep in mind, this was not added as a bug, this was the INTENDED DESIGN.The game is such a mess, everything has been put on hold. Months dedicated to fix the horrific design choices that were baked deep into the game. Also, 7 months needed to fix replenishment for 2 factions? What is going on over there? How does it take 7 months to fix things that modders fixed within hours of mods coming out?Give it a year or a little more, then it might be in a launchable state.

"Although Once Human is a well made and entertaining game, I can only recommend it to players with plenty of spare time or are happy to rush through the game to complete it before the 6 week season ends. Once Human needs private servers or 'permanent seasons (with no server wipes)' for a number of reasons, including:- Casual players want to take their time to explore the map - There is far too much content to cover in 6 weeks for players who work and/or have limited play time - Some players primarily enjoy the base building aspect and don't want their experience, deviants and base wiped - Having both seasonal and private/permanent servers would provide a variety of game development, community growth and moneymaking opportunities for developers.Side note: Content you buy with real world money should be transferable to other worlds/servers (it isn't at the moment).I will be waiting for these important issues to be dealt with before I commit to adding Once Human to my permanent game rotation.",although human well made entertain game recommend player plenti spare time happi rush game complet week season end human need privat server perman season server wipe number reason includ casual player want take time explor map far much content cover week player work andor limit play time player primarili enjoy base build aspect dont want experi deviant base wipe season privateperman server would provid varieti game develop commun growth moneymak opportun developerssid note content buy real world money transfer worldsserv isnt momenti wait import issu dealt commit ad human perman game rotat

This is very disappointing for those who were looking forwards to this game. I will update this review if it ever gets fixed. For now, I don't recommend this game due to the fact that it may be unplayable for some players.Edit: While the intro cinematic crash has been fixed, the game is still rampant with crashes.

Love the game. The only letdown for me is a lack of support for HDR and 16:10 aspect ratios.,love game letdown lack support hdr aspect ratio
"2014 Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his ""7 year old could beat you, blindfolded.""- The game mode ""Infernal"" played on the map ""de_inferno""Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as ""jokemode"" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that ""4_chan"" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :- Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.- Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.",basic gameplayy play either counterterrorist terrorist deploy battlefield round give small allow purchas weapon choicey make extra money win round could also hold knife enemi demand money although would riski sinc enemi would like shoot youon terrorist team goal plant explos near uhhm import boxesanyway plant wait patient explodea counterterrorist must elimin terrorist forc defus bomb thu protect ever import box certain destructionb honour oppon terrorist sure set bomb timer long enough give ct chanc slaughter remain ts defus bombil list positiveneg attribut game hereposit attribut matchmak teach children harsh realiti gambl although never seem learn even later rank cool look skin fast grow popul player fat stack loot drop somewhat often chicken high replay valu deathmatch game type could go detail neg part would make review long boringneg attribut although love singl player campaign could use work realli wish longer final boss fight pretti lame last around second time way lose take offens old man constantli insult year old could beat blindfold game mode infern play map deinfernosom peopl like game mode howev person dislik yet chanc experi ill explain youit seem like normal de map howev real goal scurri around find shred scrap rego normal hidden obscur unus section map abil shiftmov around differ locat even leav game entir minut time demolit also known jokemod ad pure joke volvo suppos unlock everi april fool day howev hacker probabl guy perman unlock volvo work fix ever sincedemolit game mode automat give everyon amour requir get kill weapon extrem poor damag armour oppon also block enabl whoa team killingth volka strategyy could play game like noob spend hundr dollar skin could play game correctli like strategi dont buy skin start serious wast money play good hr sell drop get wait steam sale invest mani copi csgo work way copi make sure dont get mani otherwis wont enough time harvest csgo account drop account may diminish return note take hr gameplay activ drop keep play copi frequent maximis drop economi built method buy skin free incom rememb never gambl open case ive made method think time quit day jobin whole love game would recommend anyon good half good half

"What an incredible game. I haven’t felt the want to finish a game that badly in a long time; and do as many of the achievements and things I can along the way. The combat feels great once you understand how to use the different stances together, along with spells and spirits. The story is amazing, and makes me want to watch the 1986 show and listen to the audiobook to really understand everything. That being said, Chapter 6, and one other boss in Chapter 4 are not great. The Scorpionlord, a secret boss in chapter 4, along with the first and the final bosses of the Chapter 6, just feel very unfun. There’s a lot of flying and moving and the game takes what you’ve learned through the entire game and throws it all away and even punishes you for it. Along with that, Chapter 6 feels very unfleshed and is the first instance where you see copy/paste bosses (because they are literally the same), granted they are mini bosses. In any case, I still loved this game and my time with it. I plan on going through and doing at least NG+, as there are a couple missables and I don’t think I’m that tired of the game just yet.I’d rate this a solid 8.5 or 9 out of 10 for me.

"2023 The game isn't perfect, there are areas to improve. However this is almost a new game compared to how it was at the release of total war warhammer 3. Its in a decent state. Generally gameplay, and fun has only improved as post release development has happened. The DLC is expensive. To get the most out of it you at least should own the DLC for the factions/races you enjoy the play of. If it is a game 2 faction in IE it will cost you a bit. I should assume by end of the dev phase of 3 it will be the same with a lot more factions.Be aware of this before going in. Theres no way to test factions as DLC, a try before you buy function, and the price can add up. However the gameplay is fun, it has good visuals, the over world campaign has a lot to do. The AI needs a bit more work, but even that is getting to a good point. The DLC team as well consistently does good work.

"2015 I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome.

"2022 Elden Ring is an open world game set in a world ruled by demigods and populated with beautiful environments and structures, allowing for players to traverse the Lands Between, discovering secrets, engaging in battles, and mayhap get some maidens.There are some problems with the low fps being capped at 60 for PC users but there are solutions on the internet that can help rectify this issue, in addition there is also some fps stuttering at times, it can be annoying but other than that the game is still very much playable. But with that said let us get into what I think is great and what I dislike about Elden Ring.-Enemies-Bosses:The bosses are fantastic looking and have some fantastic flashy move sets, however most of the main bosses have attacks that are too fast to be dodged, insanely long combos, always have some sort of AOE attack, and always keep moving making them hard to hit with melee weapons. Malekith the black blade fits in most of these points vie stated, having ranged abilities, difficult to dodge attacks due to his wide range of attack also making it hard to run away to heal, and a DOT (damage over time) after being hit with his blade. And this trend continues for most of the bosses, making them quite unfun.Giant bosses:Giant bosses are also quite hard to battle against, it's hard to see when they are going to attack IF you’re using melee due to you needing to be up-close to the boss.Duo bosses:Duo bosses are not too fun to fight, considering that they can kill you within 2-4 hits and you now must focus your attention on 2 enemies which considerably increases the difficulty in a cheap way.Enemies:The enemies in this game are fantastic with a wide variety of epic designs making the world feel populated, however some of them are made to be quite annoying, the Rotten Stray constantly staggering you, the Lesser Kindred of Rot with their spammable ranged attack, the Bladed Talon Eagle being hard to hit for melee users and so on.Dungeons:The dungeons are fun areas to explore, containing resources that can help the player out by giving them better weapons or useful materials. However, some of the dungeons have bosses that are too large for the area it is placed in, mostly referring to the Tree Spirit enemies. Fighting in these small rooms is extremely difficult due to the combination of your third person camera, a large boss and a small room, making it quite a challenge to know what is going on, not to mention the AOE attacks this boss has that basically reach the entire room.Too long didn’t read:Bosses are too quick with too many AOE attacks to avoid, a handful of enemies are annoying to fight against, duo bosses are hard to fight without summons but possible, hard to keep track of when giant boss will attack, small areas with big bosses are hard to fight against.-Gameplay-World:The world of Elden Ring is fantastic, not needing to always rush head in towards a boss first, you can always explore and grind levels, get better equipment before trying to battle the bosses, in addition to better equipment, you can also use summons which dramatically makes the fight easier.Combat:The combat in this game is decent, having many different attacks, light attack, heavy attack, rolling light, rolling heavy, jump light, jump heavy, sprinting heavy, sprinting light, guard counter, block, parry, and unique weapon skills that can be applied to each weapon. You can also switch between two handing and one handing weapons as well as dual wielding weapons of the same type as well as mounted combat. There is also the introduction of the stance/posture system. If you are familiar with Sekiro, it is like the posture system. After hitting the enemies enough, it will cause them to stance break and leave them susceptible to critical hits, this is also applicable for bosses too. Some attacks will cause more stance damage than others such as jumping heavy attacks, counter hits and charged heavy attacks.Rolling is a little different in this game, rather than rolling on pressing the button, you roll when the button is released.Runes:Runes from bosses and enemies are a little low. The rune scaling also does not improve much for enemies when you progress to more difficult areas, but bosses do drop more runes. And the runes you get from bosses and enemies are increased permanently after NG+ as well.But aside from all these issues this game is exceptional, one of the best Maiden Pick up simulators I've ever played, a solid 9/10, definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to get into the Souls-like franchise or anyone who is a masochist.",elden ring open world game set world rule demigod popul beauti environ structur allow player travers land discov secret engag battl mayhap get maidensther problem low fp cap pc user solut internet help rectifi issu addit also fp stutter time annoy game still much playabl said let us get think great dislik elden ringenemiesbossesth boss fantast look fantast flashi move set howev main boss attack fast dodg insan long combo alway sort aoe attack alway keep move make hard hit mele weapon malekith black blade fit point vie state rang abil difficult dodg attack due wide rang attack also make hard run away heal dot damag time hit blade trend continu boss make quit unfungi bossesgi boss also quit hard battl hard see go attack your use mele due need upclos bossduo bossesduo boss fun fight consid kill within hit must focu attent enemi consider increas difficulti cheap wayenemiesth enemi game fantast wide varieti epic design make world feel popul howev made quit annoy rotten stray constantli stagger lesser kindr rot spammabl rang attack blade talon eagl hard hit mele user ondungeonsth dungeon fun area explor contain resourc help player give better weapon use materi howev dungeon boss larg area place mostli refer tree spirit enemi fight small room extrem difficult due combin third person camera larg boss small room make quit challeng know go mention aoe attack boss basic reach entir roomtoo long didnt readboss quick mani aoe attack avoid hand enemi annoy fight duo boss hard fight without summon possibl hard keep track giant boss attack small area big boss hard fight againstgameplayworldth world elden ring fantast need alway rush head toward boss first alway explor grind level get better equip tri battl boss addit better equip also use summon dramat make fight easiercombatth combat game decent mani differ attack light attack heavi attack roll light roll heavi jump light jump heavi sprint heavi sprint light guard counter block parri uniqu weapon skill appli weapon also switch two hand one hand weapon well dual wield weapon type well mount combat also introduct stancepostur system familiar sekiro like postur system hit enemi enough caus stanc break leav suscept critic hit also applic boss attack caus stanc damag other jump heavi attack counter hit charg heavi attacksrol littl differ game rather roll press button roll button releasedrunesrun boss enemi littl low rune scale also improv much enemi progress difficult area boss drop rune rune get boss enemi increas perman ng wellbut asid issu game except one best maiden pick simul ive ever play solid definit would recommend anyon want get soulslik franchis anyon masochist

"2022 games got workshop now, and several DECENT patches.I dont think this game is bad enough to deserve a mixed review. its actually really good. its a big investment ofc. I have every DLC for all three games. not even sure how much that is total, though some were discounted. And I think some of the best races have been added in total warhammer 3. Especially the chaos additions, and there are some very interesting mechanics now in the latest DLC. its easily the best strategy game on steam by far.

I can now run the game at 1440P 60 high and some max settings.Still wont recommend as doing this method cuts you out of the online mode of the game.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance is super poor.

Do not know why it needs that much resource, maybe a deal from card makers? We don't know.They should have added FSR to alleviate this FPS issue, but hey they probably will sell more cards without it.Similar open world games like Assassins Creed Odyssey, Phantom Pain, Death Stranding, etc.. etc.. Works flawlessly on release and looked better as well with tons more goinf on in them. FromSoft games always has this issues. but hey, they will fix them later right?Can not rebind separately sprint and dodge. Walk button is also always forgotten in this types of console port.Also auto center wont ever have a toggle to turn off in this type of ports as well.Fans will still defend this game to no end and its us who is at fault and not the devs that have been babied by these fans for years. That is why this is happening constantly on every release of their games. They will never learn because they are being enabled by this fans.Maybe that is why reviewers leaves this stuff out or just sets it aside as they don't want any backlash from the tons of fans this game has, which to them the game does no wrong and so apologetic about this issues or just blame the victims.",perform fix gain fp stabil disabl easi anti cheathttpswwwwindowscentralcomhowdisableanticheateldenringep probabl bitter elden ring sold platform sabotag lol turn internet playingcrazi true somehow onlin portion eat ton resourc mayb sort spi softwar run tweak video youtub video elden ring dramat increas perform fp setup best set pc view increas fp eldenr best set pc spec optim elden ring fp fix lag reduc input latenc stutter best set better fp cant run game even lowest set tweak run game high max settingsstil wont recommend method cut onlin mode gameperform super poor stutter lot caus inconsist frame world load constantlysom particl effect take huge hit fp wellfp also poor open world area fp low set gtx tree flicker pop insgam even look good even max set know need much resourc mayb deal card maker dont knowthey ad fsr allevi fp issu hey probabl sell card without itsimilar open world game like assassin creed odyssey phantom pain death strand etc etc work flawlessli releas look better well ton goinf fromsoft game alway issu hey fix later rightcan rebind separ sprint dodg walk button also alway forgotten type consol portalso auto center wont ever toggl turn type port wellfan still defend game end us fault dev babi fan year happen constantli everi releas game never learn enabl fansmayb review leav stuff set asid dont want backlash ton fan game game wrong apologet issu blame victim

"Alright, listen up, people! I just played Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, and let me tell you, it’s an absolute spectacle. Imagine a world where chaos reigns, and you’re the unstoppable force. Yeah, that’s what it feels like!First off, the graphics? Stunning. The environments are drenched in that grimdark aesthetic we all crave. You step onto the battlefield, and it’s like stepping into a painting, only this one’s drenched in blood and glory. You can almost taste the power oh, how I love that taste!Now, the gameplay. It’s intense, brutal, and oh-so-satisfying. You’re a Space Marine superhuman, unstoppable. You charge into the fray, and every swing of your weapon feels like a symphony of destruction. The visceral combat? It’s poetry in motion, folks. You’re not just playing; you’re dominating.And let’s talk about the enemies. These guys are nothing but fodder for your glorious rampage. You’re the hero, the legend, the one everyone looks up to. You know what they say: if you’re not fighting for humanity, what are you even doing?In the end, Space Marine 2 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. It’s a reminder that power is everything, and in this universe, you’re either a god or you’re dust. So, grab your chainsword and unleash chaos!

"2023 It is painful to write this review since i play total war games since rome total war yet here we go, again.. In order for someone to enjoy everything that this game has to offer, he has to pay 🥁🥁🥁 263€..Seriously, that's amazing that they can get out with this, but is it?Who enabled them to get this far? Well, we did it. Thinking that things will get better..With every broken release, we rewarded them with our money and they just kept going, and going without fixing any of the bugs, addressing the balance between the factions and so on.The first Warhammer total war was released back on 2016, it had its bugs yet it was a fresh installment in the franchise and most of us were exited with what was to come. Then came the first DLCs which were alarming but the ""hype"" was still strong.With the release of the 2nd Warhammer total war, they added a couple of factions and a new campaign and here is where it gets interesting. In every other title in the franchise that would be an expansion/DLC for the core game like the Age of Charlemagne in Attila total war yet here the majority accepted something like that and yes, it is awful. Then came the extra DLCs with additional lords that were also overpriced yet people still found my review back them as funny even if at that time i stated the obvious missing features and bugs.Now after so many years we still have (without mods):- random crashes in battles - random crashes in changing turns- awful siege battles, the outer walls are like decorations, the inner towers are like a joke and it is pretty weird since they created Empire total war and they could just place towers manned by missile troops and have extra barricades by the units in order to actually feel that you have ground control- awful battle optimization, create a doomstack of strong missile units and you are good to go even if your enemy has armored knights or infantry since the ai is weird focusing on the lord most of the time.- awful bonuses for the ai in battle map and campaign, i mean if i played against someone that uses cheats then i would just stop playing yet in almost every total war title and here there is no exception, the ai will probably beat you but only because it's cheating, so if you play against a hard ai it will not just outsmart you, it will get the bonuses and beat you, challenging isn't it? I thought that a strategy game is all about finding the most fitting strategy to overcome your opponent- no formations for the troops like shield wall, testudo, schiltron, pike phalanx, fire by rank and so on, and the long requested mix between melee and missile units which will be useful for the starting troops to counter the beasts of this world- no meaningful upgrades for the units, it feels that the experience bonuses are like a joke with no real impact in the battle, same goes for the technology buffs of the units- no visual unit upgrades by the armory like in medieval 2 total war or like in Attila through the technology tree- awful balance between the factions, no counter strategies for certain skills/abilities- very few lord in accordance with the lore of warhammer universe, i can think of almost 40 khorne heroes yet the game has 2, well, we actually know why- poor compatibility with the mods in workshop. sometimes it's the modders fault but most of the times that comes a new patch then all of the mods need to be reworked in order to be playable- Governing systems between races are missing and the one that the empire has it's still not fixed with each electoral faction almost acting on each own without being able to allied with each other..At the end of the day, they just lost a costumer since i will never buy another of their titles if they insist on the same money grabbing practices...",pain write review sinc play total war game sinc rome total war yet go order someon enjoy everyth game offer pay that amaz get itwho enabl get far well think thing get betterwith everi broken releas reward money kept go go without fix bug address balanc faction onth first warhamm total war releas back bug yet fresh instal franchis us exit come came first dlc alarm hype still strongwith releas warhamm total war ad coupl faction new campaign get interest everi titl franchis would expansiondlc core game like age charlemagn attila total war yet major accept someth like ye aw came extra dlc addit lord also overpr yet peopl still found review back funni even time state obviou miss featur bugsnow mani year still without mod random crash battl random crash chang turn aw sieg battl outer wall like decor inner tower like joke pretti weird sinc creat empir total war could place tower man missil troop extra barricad unit order actual feel ground control aw battl optim creat doomstack strong missil unit good go even enemi armor knight infantri sinc ai weird focus lord time aw bonus ai battl map campaign mean play someon use cheat would stop play yet almost everi total war titl except ai probabl beat cheat play hard ai outsmart get bonus beat challeng isnt thought strategi game find fit strategi overcom oppon format troop like shield wall testudo schiltron pike phalanx fire rank long request mix mele missil unit use start troop counter beast world meaning upgrad unit feel experi bonus like joke real impact battl goe technolog buff unit visual unit upgrad armori like mediev total war like attila technolog tree aw balanc faction counter strategi certain skillsabl lord accord lore warhamm univers think almost khorn hero yet game well actual know poor compat mod workshop sometim modder fault time come new patch mod need rework order playabl govern system race miss one empir still fix elector faction almost act without abl alli otherat end day lost costum sinc never buy anoth titl insist money grab practic

"The first impression of the game is very good. Haven't seen much yet, 5 hours in, but grafics, controls and combat seem nice. The atmosphere is very good, except for millions of player shacks everywhere, which does ruin the atmosphere quite a bit. They should reduce the number of buildings per world, drastically. The real problem is the monetization, which is completely off. The prices for items to buy is just insane to a point, where we just won't spend a single cent on this game. Instead of having a monthly sub that enables you to get what you want, there are multiple paywalls, even if you get the battlepass or monthly sub. For example they are asking 50€ for a set of walls/doors/windows. This is insane. Not only that 10€ is the absolute maximum this should cost, you should be able to require a set like this, via your monthly sub, plus a few smaller things. Fallout76 didn't do it very well, but even they did it better than Once Human. In fact, items to build your base are a major longterm incentive to keep playing, if you can farm them ingame. Not via a battlepass though, but from dungeons and bosses, even if the drops require a monthly sub.In once Human you got an insane monetization overkill. A battlepass for over 23€. A monthly sub for 5€ and on top structural base sets and character skins for 30€ each, which you don't get via your sub and battlepass. I am sorry, but this is sick and should be boycotted, because this predatory way of monetization is about as demotivating, as your typical p2w mobile game. So unless there will be a reasonably priced monthly sub, which allows for getting one of those structural base sets or character skins plus some smaller furniture items and skins, my gf and I won't spend a single cent on this.Update 20 hours in: The game is twofold. The gaming part is fine. It is pretty much a combination of ""The Secret World"" and ""Fallout 76"" and it does a good job at that. The monetization, however is appalling. You got 2 different subs, a whole bunch of different currencies, gambling mechanics and even with both subs, you don't have it all. This is sick and i suggest not to spend any money in this game, until they come up with something decent and less invasive and greedy. The game is good though. I would gladly pay 15€ per month for a sub, but then i expect full access and no paywalls that require more money. Even the most expensive item or set, should be obtainable via a currency that you get with the monthly sub and no item or set should be more expensive, than the amount of currency, that you get per month from your sub.So while the game is good, it is impossible to recommend, due to the completely appalling monetization. For now though, you can play the game without needing any money. A nice move, but that by no means compensates the sick way, they approach monetization.",first impress game good havent seen much yet hour grafic control combat seem nice atmospher good except million player shack everywher ruin atmospher quit bit reduc number build per world drastic real problem monet complet price item buy insan point wont spend singl cent game instead monthli sub enabl get want multipl paywal even get battlepass monthli sub exampl ask set wallsdoorswindow insan absolut maximum cost abl requir set like via monthli sub plu smaller thing didnt well even better human fact item build base major longterm incent keep play farm ingam via battlepass though dungeon boss even drop requir monthli subin human got insan monet overkil battlepass monthli sub top structur base set charact skin dont get via sub battlepass sorri sick boycot predatori way monet demotiv typic mobil game unless reason price monthli sub allow get one structur base set charact skin plu smaller furnitur item skin gf wont spend singl cent thisupd hour game twofold game part fine pretti much combin secret world fallout good job monet howev appal got differ sub whole bunch differ currenc gambl mechan even sub dont sick suggest spend money game come someth decent less invas greedi game good though would gladli pay per month sub expect full access paywal requir money even expens item set obtain via currenc get monthli sub item set expens amount currenc get per month subso game good imposs recommend due complet appal monet though play game without need money nice move mean compens sick way approach monet

"2022 Elden RingLet me start by saying this was the first game I played created by FromSoftware (well except for killing the first boss in DS3 - which doesn't really count, does it?). I wasn't caught up in the Elden Ring hype and I wasn't really interested in the game even after it's release. It didn't even come up in my mind to even look at it, as I thought it wouldn't be the right game for me. And oh boy was that a mistake. About a month ago I finally decided to look into the game and almost instantly decided to get it.Not being interested in the game from the start actually made me enjoy it that much more. I wasn't hyped up from any trailers, media or rumors. I went into the game with a clean slate. And it was amazing. From the first time hearing the AWESOME soundtrack in the menu to exploring the crazy world of Lands Between - and let me tell you I barely scratched the surface of what the world has to offer.The world really feels alive. It's crazy how from previous - mostly linear - games the devs managed to create such an impressive open world. The map is HUGE and there isn't an area which feels empty and out of place. Each location really feels different and tells it's own story.There are some let's say tedious locations, I'm looking at you Mountaintops of the Giants, that get a bit annoying after playing through the game several times. Nevertheless even these snow-covered depressing hills deserve a special places in any gamer's heart. I won't mention any other locations because it would be a sin to spoil any of them.Locations being behind us, let's move onto the people inhabiting the Lands Between. The NPCs are there for themselves not for the player. That makes them feel really alive - you've never met this guy? Well he certainly doesn't care because he was doing his thing anyways. And that's crazy. The world is constantly evolving and the NPCs are too. And not just that, the people you meet during your adventure are as interesting as it gets. There weren't many times I could certainly say ""Okay, this NPC is good, pure-hearted and they will surely stay that way!"". The craziest thing is you might not meet even half of the NPCs if you're just playing the game for the sake of reaching the end.Bosses will kick your ass and those bastards will look cool doing it. Damn I wish I was born a cool boss too. But hey tough luck foul tarnished. Get some shiny gear and kick their ass for a change. After all you're ambitious and surely not foolish at all - Margit the goat fanboy.Elden Ring has 6 unique endings. That's all I'm gonna say about that. Though don't expect to be an Elden Ring Expert after your first... or tenth playthrough. The lore is, as FromSoft is known for, hidden in every possible way there is. You get a new weapon? You thought, it's lore in disguise. You got a completely useless pot which is completely useless? Oh wait it's got ten paragraphs of lore in it's description. Honestly if you really want to know atleast a bit of lore or you're interested in a certain character, I recommend you to look up external sources about them, such as youtube videos or useful lore sites. But be warned, there are still numerous mysteries which even the most notorious loreheads are still uncertain about. But hey, that's the beauty of it all, isn't it?I have to say, I don't think there currently is and for a long time will be any better entry point to FromSoft games. Even though, Elden Ring still doesn't exactly help you get through and still kicks your ass every chance it gets, it's a fun ass kicking. And I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone even a bit interested in the genre or in the game itself.It might even be time to announce a DLC reveal, what do you say FromSoft? ...pretty please?TLDR: Game of the year - do I need to add anything else? Wait... Actually I do. There are Waifus.

"F2P game. Ingame Shop that only provides cosmetics. No P2W at all! All these critics regarding the EULA are completely irrelevant and shouldnt be regarded! These conditions are completely normal!Started Phase 2 today. So far the game is quite fun! The game loop seems like this: Discover a new area, complete 1-2 quests, use a certain amount of some stations in cities scattered around the area. In the end you defeat a boss and go to the next area. In the meantime you farm resources and build your base, craft weapons/ armor and slay!Difficulty: So far its not really difficult at all. Difficulty increases by region. To be as strong as before youll have to craft new armor/ weapon. Nothing new here.Cons: It kinda feels like a mobile port. But its not thaaaaaat bad .... Result: A fun game thats actually kinda addicting. Its a kind of a Valheim\Rust survival game but combined with raids and bosses that you know from MMORPGsedit: After a while some more input:I do still recommend the game BUT it has issues! For example- You get warnings, when you click your mouse too fast. So using the furnaces and getting all your stuff out may be more problematic than you might think. - Water Pumps behave VERY weird. - There isnt that much content if you think about it. Every region has like 10 quests in total and maybe 6-8 ""cities"" (towns with 10-40 buildings) to discover. So by now i more or less have done everything for Phase 2 of the Season. And that phase started yesterday! Phase 3 starts next week! - Yes you are gated by phases that disable lots of content to keep you playing for the whole season!- There are bugs! (I was running below the world yesterday, i fell troguh the floor and ran across the void for example) (stopping a craft destroys all already completed materials in my opinion a bug, destroying the crafting building also destroys all materials that were still inside as well)- There are lag issues!- Also even tho its a game with mining, farming and so on in it. There isnt that much you can craft actually. Most things are just improved version of others.- The ""grind"" isnt really grindy ...- Wipes every 6 weeks (wipes are good for these kind of games but 6 weeks may be a bit short for a lot of people)- Most bosses are (so far) simply bullet sponges and easily killed solo. There are exceptions but just because you wont be able to move if you would carry all the ammo you would need to kill that thing!- Its lacking a LOT of QOL features (you can for example drop all items in a chest but cant empty the chest immediately. But have to empty it to destroy it) Thats it so far. I would still recommend it just because its F2P and still fun to play!

"2022 So after almost 60 hours, I've completed 3 campaigns and poked around at a handful of others. The game has some shining spots in it while also having a lot of major issues with the gameplay and performance at the moment.Pros:-WH3 is absolutely beautiful when graphics are turned to high. The detail of the map, battle maps, and units are very detailed.-The factions are very fun to play depending on how you like to play your campaigns. I find that most units are balanced well throughout each faction's roster.-The Narrative is absolutely amazing overall. During my first playthrough, I was captivated by the prologue and the story told throughout.-The soundtrack is amazing to listen to while playing as certain factions. Cons:-The game does not perform well at all even if you have a strong computer. It is impossible to have more than 25 frames if you are running any other program in the background. I could only achieve 60 fps by turning all of my graphics settings down.-The mechanics of the base campaign are ATROCIOUS. Without going into too much detail, the main campaign requires you to complete 4 different chaos areas which significantly punish you for completing them. Unlike the previous campaign ion WH2, you are FORCED to play the narrative even if you don't want to. If you would like to read more on why the chaos mechanic is atrocious go read LegendofTotalWar's post on it.-Because of the previously stated problem, there is no incentive to continue to play the game with the forced narrative because you have already seen it. After the first few campaigns, it becomes somewhat repetitive to deal with making the game not fun.Overall I would recommend this game yes, but after they have fixed some of the mechanics and the campaign or release Mortal Empires version.",almost hour ive complet campaign poke around hand other game shine spot also lot major issu gameplay perform absolut beauti graphic turn high detail map battl map unit detailedth faction fun play depend like play campaign find unit balanc well throughout faction rosterth narr absolut amaz overal first playthrough captiv prologu stori told throughoutth soundtrack amaz listen play certain faction consth game perform well even strong comput imposs frame run program background could achiev fp turn graphic set downth mechan base campaign atroci without go much detail main campaign requir complet differ chao area significantli punish complet unlik previou campaign ion forc play narr even dont want would like read chao mechan atroci go read legendoftotalwar post itbecaus previous state problem incent continu play game forc narr alreadi seen first campaign becom somewhat repetit deal make game funoveral would recommend game ye fix mechan campaign releas mortal empir version
"2022 Its the logical progression of what FROM software has done since the release of Demon's Souls. Lessons learned from each entry from the Dark Souls trilogy, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro have all culminated into an environment that is well crafted, yet immeasurably huge. Is it difficult, sure, but not any more than any of the others. A well crafted experience that contains plenty of tools for anyone to use to make the experience easier or harder on themselves.

"Too many people leaving bad reviews only hours after this game was released simply because they couldn't create another character right away, even though the devs said they were planning on adding additional character creation later on. I streamed this earlier. The game runs smooth, the crafting and building is easy, the map is GIGANTIC, and not to mention the game is FREE. There is a battle pass you can buy in game to get some extra stuff but the devs mentioned you can get all the weapons for free. This has to arguably be the best free game I've ever played.

"I am quite impressed with this game both in terms of its gameplay and visuals after finishing the introduction. I'm excited to start playing the rest of the game in co-op with my sister. However, I cannot ever recommend a game that forcibly installs unnecessary Epic Games bloatware on your PC upon initial launch. I bought* a Steam game to play with other players on Steam only. (*Well actually, my lovely sister gifted me the game, but my statement remains otherwise the same. Thank you so much, sis! ^-^) Fortunately, as long as you don't care about crossplay, the game is entirely functional without Epic Games Online and it can be easily removed from the installation. Here's how to do so.1) Launch the game. The game will immediately attempt to install Epic Online Services. Cancel the installation box before it finishes. You will be met with an error message upon reaching the main menu. The EOS was never successfully installed, but remnants of the software are still on your machine.2) Turn off crossplay in the game options menu of the game.3) Close the game. Uninstall Epic Online Services from the list of programs on your computer.4) Delete the Epic Online Services folder from the game's installation folder in your Steam library.5) Reboot your computer and relaunch the game. The game will greet you with the error message when you reach the main menu whenever you start the game, but EOS will never again attempt to install itself on your machine. The game is fully functional without crossplay.

"EDIT: Have to change to a negative review unfortunately. The Devs said during a stream yesterday that there aren’t enough OCE players playing to justify making a new server. Not sure what they what server they thought the OCE players would be playing on. Very disappointing as the gameplay is fun, but any mid-late game content will be impossible with this ping. Will revisit this review if they ever support Aussies playing their game. ORIGINAL POSITIVE REVIEW: Awesome game. Feels like the love child of the division, monster hunter, rust and new world. Unfortunately no OCE servers, so getting 115-145 ping in Australia. Hoping that they get us a PvP and PvE server quickly before the Aussie players move on to another game.I have only seen negative reviews about issues that have been fixed or addressed.

"This game introduced a fresh vibe to the gaming world with a unique system that blends the style of God of War and Souls games. The gameplay is incredibly engaging and fits the story perfectly.The world is absolutely beautiful, and the graphics need no further praise—we’ve all seen the incredible details the game delivered using the new Unreal Engine 5. Even though the development team is relatively new to AAA third-person games, they crafted a visual masterpiece. However, the game is quite demanding and could use more optimization on various platforms. Even with my RTX 4090, I had to lower some settings to maintain high frame rates.One issue I had with the world design is that when I wanted to revisit older areas, I often forgot the locations and had to retrace my steps, which was tiring. The absence of a map in the game made this process even more challenging. This alone can cause players to miss out on important content or side bosses and rewards.Additionally, some of the secret areas were a bit misleading. I wouldn’t have discovered any of them without YouTube. You know the type—where you have to perform a million steps, many of which seem random, just to unlock a specific secret location.As for the bosses, I was absolutely thrilled with the fights. There’s a great variety, and each boss has a unique combat style. Every encounter felt different, requiring you to think of specific strategies to beat them. I really enjoyed the diversity and the number of bosses.The leveling system fits the gameplay style perfectly and was engaging, pushing me to explore secret areas and hidden bosses to strengthen my character and acquire new skills. The skill tree was diverse and extensive; even after completing the game, there were still many skills I hadn’t discovered or tried. This is a good sign that I’ll continue with New Game+.The story, while not the best in gaming, was enjoyable and gave me insight into Chinese cultures and characters.The game offers multiple endings.My final rating for the game is a solid 9 out of 10.",game introduc fresh vibe game world uniqu system blend style god war soul game gameplay incred engag fit stori perfectlyth world absolut beauti graphic need praisewev seen incred detail game deliv use new unreal engin even though develop team rel new aaa thirdperson game craft visual masterpiec howev game quit demand could use optim variou platform even rtx lower set maintain high frame rateson issu world design want revisit older area often forgot locat retrac step tire absenc map game made process even challeng alon caus player miss import content side boss rewardsaddit secret area bit mislead wouldnt discov without youtub know typewher perform million step mani seem random unlock specif secret locationa boss absolut thrill fight there great varieti boss uniqu combat style everi encount felt differ requir think specif strategi beat realli enjoy divers number bossesth level system fit gameplay style perfectli engag push explor secret area hidden boss strengthen charact acquir new skill skill tree divers extens even complet game still mani skill hadnt discov tri good sign ill continu new gameth stori best game enjoy gave insight chines cultur charactersth game offer multipl endingsmi final rate game solid
"One of the few games worth full price in awhile IMO. If the game had another month or two in the oven I feel it would have been next to perfect at launch bug wise.

"2022 Hands down one of the best games I've ever played! I'm kind of new to the Soulsborne type of games, some of my gaming friends used to be die hard Dark Souls players, however for some reason I never got into it. But Elden Ring sucked me in and I managed to spend a ton of fun hours in it. In times like this when greedy publishers like EA are all about lootboxes and pleasing their shareholders, these FromSoftware boys come out with this gem and show us what it feels like to play a proper game again, thanks guys! I'm actually gonna start playing Dark Souls after this.Awesome game, highly replayable, beautiful world and no gated content.

"2023 Terrible launch. Boring main campaign with a horrible ""domination"" multiplayer mode. It was an early access.Since the release of Inmortal Empires, the game has improved a lot.The DLC policy was already bad before, now they have made the expansions even more expensive and with less content.I must mention the company's bad attitude towards its playerbase: from veiled threats of discontinuation of the game and censorship regarding player opinions. Intolerable behavior.Currently it seems that they have improved the pace of updates.

"2017 Product received for free After playing the game for roughly 500 hours, I have come to a point that I should express my opinion about the game's current state.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a highly competitive game that focuses on team wo--. Really? You REALLY think im going to describe this game as the perfect cut gem of an E-Sports title?.... well, you came to the wrong review comrade!In essence, CS:GO in its current state has some things you really wouldn't want in a game of this type:-Cheaters/VAC:Most of them obviously have been cheating for a long time, but what does valve care? The only thing useful they do is milk their games for money until they are bone dry and deserted. I just can't get over that fact that valve hasn't actually ""noticed"" that their anti-cheat has flaws, but instead they keep releasing more useless items than bug fixing updates for the game itself.-Griefers:They are not really common nowadays, but back in the day every 5/10 - 6/10 competitive matches i went would have atleast 1 griefer that didn't do anything but insult,generally discriminate or just flat-out do absolutely nothing to help the team win a single round. These individuals are most commonly found on the lower ranks, from my experience.-SMURFS:I have seen more smurfs in cs:go matchmaking than in the actual cartoon itself.Basically this ruins the game for new players by giving them the appearance that CS:GO just isn't worth playing if you don't know how.-THE SALTENING BEGINS:Do you want to experience more highly concentrated amounts of salt in one match than in a salt mine, followed by a community of 12 year olds more cancerous than the radiation levels at Chernobyl? Well my friend, CS:GO is the game for you! (Warranty for broken mice, keyboards, screens, headsets, desks, windows, and possibly hands from hitting your desk too hard not included.)-Servers:When I mean servers I don't intend to talk about the ping/lag, but instead about how most of the time I get matched against/with people from the other side of the damn galaxy. (This is good if you want to learn how everyone has had sexual intercourse with your family members/pets in diverse languages, while you simultaneously proceed to lose the match.)TL;DR:CS:GO is a game that gives everybody a different experience (Unless you are playing in russia, then it's always B rushed every round). Cringy jokes aside, I think this game is somewhat addicting and pleasant in the long run, despite the initial steep learning curve. If valve ever decides to ACTUALLY update their anti-cheat system I will be more than happy to play this game more often.Cheers,James.",product receiv free play game roughli hour come point express opinion game current statecounterstrik global offens highli competit game focus team wo realli realli think im go describ game perfect cut gem esport titl well came wrong review comradein essenc csgo current state thing realli wouldnt want game typecheatersvacmost obvious cheat long time valv care thing use milk game money bone dri desert cant get fact valv hasnt actual notic anticheat flaw instead keep releas useless item bug fix updat game itselfgriefersthey realli common nowaday back day everi competit match went would atleast griefer didnt anyth insultgener discrimin flatout absolut noth help team win singl round individu commonli found lower rank experiencesmurfsi seen smurf csgo matchmak actual cartoon itselfbas ruin game new player give appear csgo isnt worth play dont know howth salten beginsdo want experi highli concentr amount salt one match salt mine follow commun year old cancer radiat level chernobyl well friend csgo game warranti broken mice keyboard screen headset desk window possibl hand hit desk hard includedserverswhen mean server dont intend talk pinglag instead time get match againstwith peopl side damn galaxi good want learn everyon sexual intercours famili memberspet divers languag simultan proceed lose matchtldrcsgo game give everybodi differ experi unless play russia alway b rush everi round cringi joke asid think game somewhat addict pleasant long run despit initi steep learn curv valv ever decid actual updat anticheat system happi play game oftencheersjam

"I wholeheartedly recommend Black Myth: Wukong to any fan of Souls-like games. This title has become a true addiction for me. While some boss encounters have tested my patience, I recognize that it's more a matter of improving my own skill through trial and error. The game is a masterful work of art, inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, yet telling the story in its own unique and captivating way. Every scene, every battle, and every chapter is presented with such stunning visual spectacle that it's impossible not to be drawn in by its beauty.

"2023 Creative Assembly refuses to fix game breaking bugs for 6+ months, reneges on many many promises to fix under-performing areas of the game, and threatens to pull the plug on the game's ""support"" (lol what support?) if people don't accept their new 150% price hike for upcoming and future DLCs.

With the current level of management, however, it's never getting there.

"2015 (Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the ass. Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or 2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet.

"2019 Tl;dr - fun and a competitive game. Has it's toxic side just like any other multiplayer game. 8/10 would recommend it. This game is the epitome of reflex. I love this game because it's simple yet the most complex of strategies can be implied. It doesn't just test your mechanical skill but also makes you really put in a mental effort. Really fun in a competitive 5 man lobby. Thank heavens this game enables you to access the settings menu whilst queuing for a match.. it was due for years. The new UI seems innovative but I suppose there is still more room for improvement. Having about an average number of hours. here's what the pros and cons of this game are to me- Pros: If you love a fast paced competitive game, this is the game for you. Simple (no breaking walls and ♥♥♥♥) yet it's fun and there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ you can do to achieve success - victory, fun, both; whatever objective you have set for yourself/definition you have set for the word. Could also make a great game to play casually between other games, you find these kinds of players mostly in the lower ranks. In-game ranking system to motivate you on a short-term to play more and get better. Besides the Competitive (classic 5v5) game mode, there are many others you can choose from. Community made maps and skins to give you a better experience. Being updated regularly- new maps, changes in existing maps, changes in the economy in-game, etc,- leads to creating new metas. 3rd party matchmaking clients (ESEA, SoStronk, Faceit) offer more opportunities with more stable and better servers (128 tick), tournaments over various periods of time, in-built ranking system with lots of prizes to be won- really brings out the most out of this game- thus leading to a newer and better experience, for the ones who take this game seriously and for the ones who play casually both alike. Very active and an entertaining e-sport scene- the content it provides really shows that humans are capable of the impossible. Pretty cool community, I've played a lot of other games and have been a part of many communities but I've got to say the CS:GO community is pretty cool. We have one of the smartest, one of the most humorous communities on Twitch, Reddit and on YouTube, unlike in other games where at least one of these platforms are more cancerous than the better part of them. And ah, some extremely attractive female streamers and pro players.Cons- Matchmaking servers are the worst... I don't know what the devs have planned for this game. The servers are never stable and really ruins the experience for us. This game was at a point where all of us were gonna request Valve to upgrade the MM servers to 128 tick but really need to resort to 3rd party clients and many of us really don't want to do that ALL the time or cannot. So many bugs and stuff being abused in maps and this game takes forever to get them fixed. I know this is a long shot since it took them years to make other sub-menus accessible while in queue for a match.. but would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GREAT if we had the option to choose servers. Indians and Pinoys are literally the worst. I'm not generalising but you know it makes no difference to generalise or not because I've never had a good experience with players from these nations. They RUIN our games. Can't have one fun match without an incompetent Indian crying on the mic in Hindi about some really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like just shut the ♥♥♥♥ UP dude. Always looking for something to blame, extremely annoying when they rush first, die and then comment on what you're doing and if you don't do as they say they just have a mental breakdown on mic. Thank goodness this game is capable of a block communication feature. I don't even know how they get to the ranks they do with their intellectually incapable selves. They're extremely bad and just hold your team down. Super toxic. I don't mind losing because it's a fair part of the game but the games are just RUINED by these players. Coming from overpopulated countries where they don't get enough attention or where they can't get any due to the lack of a special talent, they just show their frustration on the mic and ruin the experience for us. Videos on YouTube get super popular in the CS:GO communities and these players just try out tricks/tips/ whatever BUGS they've discovered etc. and because of their incompetency they fail and it isn't fun nor productive. Request to all Indian and Filipinos- please do not try out the stuff you see on videos. They hold an IQ threshold that you people cannot match. It only ruins our games. And I'm sure every region has some ♥♥♥♥ like this so it's only fair CS:GO let's us choose our servers to reduce the risk of getting into a game with an Indian or whoever with an underdeveloped brain. Hackers and smurfs are still into existence despite the efforts of Valve. It bums me the ♥♥♥♥ out because I've exchanged a lot more time and effort to get to the same rank as the hacker or smurf did only to get paired against them for a definite loss in elo points. Ruined the game after it became f2p. After this game turned f2p the servers became WORSE due to the high load and they removed the option to report servers. It's like they knew it was bound to happen. Great, the game struggled with stable mm servers and now make the game f2p and introduce the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Battle Royale in existence - Danger Zone. Poorly optimised game, anybody that gets <250 fps know the huge drop in fps when in smokes etc. Hope Valve does something about the servers and add more features to this game instead of funding some ♥♥♥♥ p2w garbage like ARTIFACT that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about. -Tips for new players: 1. Get some friends to play with to begin with. More known players more the merrier.2. You can completely customise how the games looks for you. Crosshair, viewmodel etc can be adjusted for your convenience. Make use of it.3. Watch videos. 4. Indians/Pinoys on your team or general mic cancer teammates? Type enable_voice 0 in console.. you're welcome.Conclusion: It's a fun game if you've a taste for competitiveness. Lower skill curve yet hard to master. 8/10 would recommend it.My first review and it's long as ♥♥♥♥ I don't think most of you would read it- but for those who have regardless of whether you relate to my review or not, thank you for spending time on this. Really appreciate it.

"2017 Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers.Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost. Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack. In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course you are not able to switch the teammates. Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no ""Team-Language"" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?All in all CS-GO is a nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.Cheers",absolut recommend insan ammount hackerstoday drop global elit suprem lost game smfc rage hack kid one game ahead oppon left join back round later jsut announc quickli download hack ragecarri remain round get mvp obvious lost dont get wrong strong player game hit insan shot almost k hour counterstrik experi tell least match one hacker even count insan amount player use kind radar hack fact valv doesnt even care tri get rid hacker problem realli instead keep ad skin case pay overwatch function seem nice earli state watch overwatch session cant hear ingam voic chat pretti much make useless want hear keep play music ingam use microphon keep flame hacker call ingam see scoreboard pov suspect cours abl switch teammat counterstrik anticheat damn useless friend year program experi abl build hack undetect yearsanoth problem ist commun player lem queue mate speak explicit languag hell teamlanguag option ingam fix kind thingsal csgo nice skillbas shooter high potenti ruin compani interest milk cow highli toxic commun enjoy game would actual need buy esea play kind compet match would make cs go kind senselessch

Review:Besides some bad PC optimization, some stutters which seem to only occur at the worst possible moment, this game is what I would consider a beautiful byproduct had Zelda Breath of the Wild and Dark Souls 3 spent a night in an Inn while it was raining outside. It has both open world, and in this case not the empty EA/Ubisoft kind where exploring will actually reward you. I cant count the number of times I have been to some god forsaken corner of the map and I actually found some hidden loot there. Meanwhile, it also presents the players will challenges like the bosses are significantly harder than those in Dark Souls 3. I am as of right now only 20hrs in and the ending is nowhere in site, honestly I don't even want to see it. This game has been hands down the best game I have played in the last five years.

Seasons change with different scenarios and challenges which will provide fresh gameplay despite the wipes. Important progress carries over between seasons, so your efforts are not in vain. The game does have it's share of bugs, as is typical for a new release, but nothing game breaking.

2022 69 hours in (lol noice!) with very heavy exploration of the first few areas and the map and secrets just do not seem to end. There is always a new area to go to. There is always an NPC putting you up to some obscure questline.I caught a glimpse of the actual map from wiki and I have around 40-50% of the map yet to uncover. And some of the best areas and bosses of the game are entirely optional and some are even hidden behind highly obscure questlines which you can 100% miss.I am simply lost for words trying to explain just how magnificent the map design is. This is like they took the map design from dark souls 1 and cranked it up to 10000 on steroids.This game is sheer insanity in terms of how beautiful it is and how fun it is(if you like souls games atleast).This is truly a generational title and should be on everybody's wishlist.Rating - Masterpiece/10,hour lol noic heavi explor first area map secret seem end alway new area go alway npc put obscur questlinei caught glimps actual map wiki around map yet uncov best area boss game entir option even hidden behind highli obscur questlin missi simpli lost word tri explain magnific map design like took map design dark soul crank steroidsthi game sheer insan term beauti fun isif like soul game atleastthi truli gener titl everybodi wishlistr

"2022 I think it's finally time to change this review from negative to positive. A lot has happened and changed since I last updated this review, but the gist of it is, that CA has done a good job on fixing some of the glaring issues and began a sincere communication with their TWWH community. The game itself has an insane amount of content, looks good, runs good, sounds good. Really scratches that strategy game itch that one gets from time to time (beware the ""just one more turn"" syndrome!).

"9/10 I definitely recommend getting acquainted with the project.At first, the game may seem superficial and rather ordinary with the usual boring gameplay, but it is not!Starting from the 2nd chapter, it reveals all its strengths, it is interesting to explore, there are many secrets, the combat system develops into a simply crazy mixture of everything you can imagine and a simply colossal assortment of various bosses, only Elden Ring can compete with it!81 ratings from journalists, because they did not really play, the maximum they were able to get to the 2nd chapter and draw conclusions)I think that the game deserves more, and such a huge, large-scale game was made by the developers in just 4 years, it really deserves respect!

2022 UPDATE: While I am leaving my original review below because it's still relevant my review remains a hard no unless on sale. Marked up DLCs that add less and less just add to the original pain of this title and it's clear the devs at this point are just giving everyone the middle finger.If I could leave a 'neutral' review I would but since I can't it's a thumbs down from me.The campaign was fun the first time albeit a spit in the face to WH lore in general which has just been made up for the sake of the campaign. That's that part that really irks me most.Paying $90AU for a handful of factions and nil replayability though was what added salt to the wound. They talked this guy up so much and produced something which was woeful in content. I'd expect what I got from an indie dev paying $30-$40 for this but from CA at full price? It's a con job for sure.As of writing this review wait for a 50% off before purchasing if you're keen.

"2022 Sieges and battles: Sieges are full of choke points, little open space. Any units can scale the walls, they aren't equippable and the units don’t have to drag the ladders to the walls. Battles more generally are more simple than other Total War titles. Feels like they took some of the challenge out of the game, in order to make it appeal to a wider audience. Graphics: This is the best aspect in my opinion, the game looks gorgeous. Map(s): With the immortal empires patch you get the entire world, which is great.Lore: I feel the game could tell the story a bit more, in Three Kingdoms, there are cut-scenes when you reach certain goals, you get an idea and feel for the events around you. Heroes: Sometimes the heroes can get a bit jarring. I wish there where a “records mode” type of option, not because I don´t like heroes, rather because it would bee more challenging in certain situations to have a generals retinue. The Daemon Prince for example is kinda weak and tends to be useless. Balthasar Gelt can almost alone defeat armies with his magic artillery spells. Another solution would be to rebalanced the heroes.Unit size: I also find the unit sizes of the different units quite small, this is important since this game is supposed to be an fantasy epic, but with tiny battles. Well, what about fixing this with mods? You can, there are mods in the workshop that increase the unit size, however, the AI tends to get stuck at the gate and exhibit odd and often devastating (for them) behavior. While, in three kingdoms I use similar mods and have massive battles with a full stack army almost reaching 10,000 warriors. The AI in Three Kingdoms doesn’t exhibit the same issues.AI: I personally find the AI a bit lackluster compared to other titles, though not as catastrophic as Thrones of Britannia. It’s not bad, just not cutting it for an experienced player like me. I also tend to be against increasing the difficulty to legendary, due to the AI getting modifier boosts, thus I prefer to use a AI mod that makes the AI smarter instead. Found that Hecleas AI Mod works well. Diplomacy: I find that the diplomatic options to interact with other factions are a bit limited. Currently you can sway someone with giving them money, but you can’t for example trade ancillaries like in Three Kingdoms. Sometimes I might be just short of getting that trade agreement, but not enough money to to finish the deal, while sitting on a pile of old/useless ancillaries that I could do away with.Linux: Works great, I personally have used it with Proton and played with my friends.SummaryHmm, it’s a good total war game in my view, but not a great one. The game looks just gorgeous and is pure eye-candy, the fantasy setting is also interesting. If you really love fantasy, stuff like Lord of the Rings etc. then you might find the full price justified, but if Fantasy is cool, but not your absolute favorite thing then, I would personally recommend waiting for a -50% sale and then get it.",sieg battl sieg full choke point littl open space unit scale wall arent equipp unit dont drag ladder wall battl gener simpl total war titl feel like took challeng game order make appeal wider audienc graphic best aspect opinion game look gorgeou map immort empir patch get entir world greatlor feel game could tell stori bit three kingdom cutscen reach certain goal get idea feel event around hero sometim hero get bit jar wish record mode type option dont like hero rather would bee challeng certain situat gener retinu daemon princ exampl kinda weak tend useless balthasar gelt almost alon defeat armi magic artilleri spell anoth solut would rebalanc heroesunit size also find unit size differ unit quit small import sinc game suppos fantasi epic tini battl well fix mod mod workshop increas unit size howev ai tend get stuck gate exhibit odd often devast behavior three kingdom use similar mod massiv battl full stack armi almost reach warrior ai three kingdom doesnt exhibit issuesai person find ai bit lacklust compar titl though catastroph throne britannia bad cut experienc player like also tend increas difficulti legendari due ai get modifi boost thu prefer use ai mod make ai smarter instead found heclea ai mod work well diplomaci find diplomat option interact faction bit limit current sway someon give money cant exampl trade ancillari like three kingdom sometim might short get trade agreement enough money finish deal sit pile olduseless ancillari could away withlinux work great person use proton play friendssummaryhmm good total war game view great one game look gorgeou pure eyecandi fantasi set also interest realli love fantasi stuff like lord ring etc might find full price justifi fantasi cool absolut favorit thing would person recommend wait sale get
"Product received for free I have about 25 hours in this game currently since release date; been taking my time, exploring every nook and cranny (though the invisible walls are HELLA ANNOYING) and investing myself in all the lore with the enemy short stories and I'm only probably halfway done with Ch. 2.Been avoiding all spoilers and playing mostly blind as that's the best way to play in my opinion and given that I've been playing Demons Souls since '09 I'm familiar with the tricks with hidden bosses / secret areas and backtracking with an acquired item and figuring that stuff out so it's not too bad for me due to my experience with the genre.The game is more ARPG (Action Role-Playing Game) with shared elements of the Souls games and though some of the bosses I've encountered have frustrated me, I'm also having FUN, which says a lot and the feeling of finally defeating an enemy is extremely liberating and euphoric.

"Playing this, gave me the same amount of excitement when I played God of war (2018) for the very first time. Being the first AAA title from the developer, I think they pretty much nailed it.This is what I was able to gather during my short playtime.Pros:1. A+ combat mechanics. Easy enough to learn, complex enough to keep it interesting.2. Art and sound direction are on point. Absolutely stunning. Especially the variety of bosses.3. Well optimized. I'm averaging 70-80 fps in high settings on my Zephyrus G14 4060.4. The skill point system is well thought of. Rewards you even if you keep dying when doing boss rush. Cons:1. I wished the game had mo-caped for English dialogues and had better dialogues in general. It kinda throws me off when the characters talk.

"2022 Okay, I think it's okay to say now. Having gotten through those first two patches, (1.1 & 1.2) the game is now safe to recommend. Initially, I think CA had botched it. The patches that addressed the build to reduce portals (1.1) and the auto-resolve (1.2) have saved this game. It is now in a place where I can more enjoy the mechanics and tempo of the game.Yes, once the big map that joins the three games AND all the races together will be what we've all been waiting for. But for now, getting familiar with the new and very different races and race mechanics, the minor settlement rework, the constant threat of the portal race that means you can still lose even when steamrolling. Yeah, this is a good game and I'm enjoying it.Would I have said that a month or so ago? Well, let's just say there's a reason I've waited before submitting a review.Long live the DLC team that are the real geniuses that breath life and longevity to this epic game",okay think okay say gotten first two patch game safe recommend initi think ca botch patch address build reduc portal autoresolv save game place enjoy mechan tempo gamey big map join three game race togeth weve wait get familiar new differ race race mechan minor settlement rework constant threat portal race mean still lose even steamrol yeah good game im enjoy itwould said month ago well let say there reason ive wait submit reviewlong live dlc team real genius breath life longev epic game

"SummaryCampaign: <15 hours of loreful hack n slash fun. PvE: Fun with friends, but undercooked, linear and clunkyPvP: Fun with friends, but bare bones and unbalanced I recently replayed Space Marine 1, and the sequel is a much better game. The visuals, sound and feel are all spot on for a Space Marine fantasy. However, it doesn't quite achieve everything it sets out to, and its secondary modes fall short of other similar games. CampaignThis is very much a 40k story, with writing reminiscent of a black library novel. That is both good and bad, with the over the top sclock, bravado, action and machismo you'd expect. The grim reality of the Imperium is acknowledged, but on the whole it leans closer to glorification than critique. The gameplay is a continuation of the first game's mechanics and feel, with chainswords and plasma guns feeling suitably impactful. It is highly linear, without meaningful choice and very little exploration. Being combat oriented and straight to the point is very Astartes, but would have grown wearisome if the campaign were any longer. The scripted executions are similarly timed to stay interesting right up to the end of the campaign, but perhaps not much longer.There are obvious missed opportunities here. Like the vehicle levels which have placeholder cutscenes but don't let you control them, or terrain destruction which happens all around you, but you can't actually change. its also quite short, at under ten hours if you race through, or perhaps 15 if you take your time and play the optional missions as they unlock.Still, overall it is an enjoyable romp over a couple of days PvE This is the bulk of the end game replayability, and the customisation will please many tabletop fans. However it has some key limitations. It doesn't have the visual depth or gunplay of Darktide, nor the endless variety and replayability of Vermintide or Left for Dead. This is a much more linear experience where you replay the same maps over and over. You do get variety from the different classes and upgrades, but progression is largely cosmetic or minor stat buffs. Beyond the limited number of maps, skills and enemies, there are also pretty limited number of weapons, with quite a few slots having only a single option. You're likely to get dozens of hours of fun here, but maybe not hundreds. The repetition of things like execution animations which started to show in the campaign will become very clear over repeated play throughs of these levels. There is a roadmap with more content, lets hope there is enough in the pipeline to keep the juices flowing.PvP This is a throwback to a different kind of multiplayer, back to the days of unreal tournament or halo at a LAN party. There is a very low time to kill, and strong reliance on team coordination. There are only three maps with three game modes, so the replayability here is again limited by content availability. PvP will be fun to play at launch, and if you have a crew together, but may struggle to drag people away from the hero shooters and mobas of the world long term. ConclusionThis is a fun and brutal distraction for a few dozen hours. For some it will be a realisation of their childhood fantasy, for others it will be a gateway into an addiction they didn't know they wanted. It is a great entry into the set of warhammer games, and a worthy sequel to a fun game. It won't revolutionise the industry, but it does show that going back to basics and delivering what the fans want is a sound strategy for a good time.",summarycampaign hour lore hack n slash fun pve fun friend undercook linear clunkypvp fun friend bare bone unbalanc recent replay space marin sequel much better game visual sound feel spot space marin fantasi howev doesnt quit achiev everyth set secondari mode fall short similar game campaignthi much stori write reminisc black librari novel good bad top sclock bravado action machismo youd expect grim realiti imperium acknowledg whole lean closer glorif critiqu gameplay continu first game mechan feel chainsword plasma gun feel suitabl impact highli linear without meaning choic littl explor combat orient straight point astart would grown wearisom campaign longer script execut similarli time stay interest right end campaign perhap much longerther obviou miss opportun like vehicl level placehold cutscen dont let control terrain destruct happen around cant actual chang also quit short ten hour race perhap take time play option mission unlockstil overal enjoy romp coupl day pve bulk end game replay customis pleas mani tabletop fan howev key limit doesnt visual depth gunplay darktid endless varieti replay vermintid left dead much linear experi replay map get varieti differ class upgrad progress larg cosmet minor stat buff beyond limit number map skill enemi also pretti limit number weapon quit slot singl option your like get dozen hour fun mayb hundr repetit thing like execut anim start show campaign becom clear repeat play through level roadmap content let hope enough pipelin keep juic flowingpvp throwback differ kind multiplay back day unreal tournament halo lan parti low time kill strong relianc team coordin three map three game mode replay limit content avail pvp fun play launch crew togeth may struggl drag peopl away hero shooter moba world long term conclusionthi fun brutal distract dozen hour realis childhood fantasi other gateway addict didnt know want great entri set warhamm game worthi sequel fun game wont revolutionis industri show go back basic deliv fan want sound strategi good time

"2023 After playing WH2 for hours and obviously enjoying the game, I was really looking forward to WH3. However, as soon as the game was out, my dissapointment was immeasurable and my day(s) ruined. Lots of features and gameplay were buggy (nothing new for CA, unfortunately) and the motivation to play a campaign for more than 50 turns (usually 1-2h) was nowhere to be found due to the state of the game. Minor fixes were out in the coming months, but they didn't change much as to enjoy the game as much as I did WH2.At the same time, CA kept churning out DLC after DLC with less and less content, while major issues still persisted with the base game. Several years have passed and the developers are still unable to make the game enjoyable while stating they need more and more money to keep the ""support up"". This is absolutely inacceptale and I will refrain from buying ANYTHING from CA ever again that costs more than 5$ because honestly, that's was the content of their DLC's and buggy main games amount to. Luckily, there are other games/ game studios worth looking into.Verdict: Do Not Buy, CA has gone down the greedy dev route and there is no sign they will change anytime soon.",play hour obvious enjoy game realli look forward howev soon game dissapoint immeasur day ruin lot featur gameplay buggi noth new ca unfortun motiv play campaign turn usual nowher found due state game minor fix come month didnt chang much enjoy game much time ca kept churn dlc dlc less less content major issu still persist base game sever year pass develop still unabl make game enjoy state need money keep support absolut inacceptal refrain buy anyth ca ever cost honestli that content dlc buggi main game amount luckili game game studio worth look intoverdict buy ca gone greedi dev rout sign chang anytim soon

"The majority of negative reviews in a nutshell:1: I didn't coordinate with my friends on which server we were going to play on so I am now mad at the world that we cant play together and I have to start over on a new server and I lose my progress.2: The typical TOS misunderstanding that these cyber security expert wannabes flail around recklessly without actually understanding what the TOS means. TLDR, the game is backed by GDPR guidelines and if it was breaking them it wouldn't be sold in the US.3: Queue times for servers. The game just released, every new mmo/server hosted game has queues on release, get over it.My review:SO FAR, this game has delivered on every single aspect of survival/mmo/looter shooter that I have wanted in a game, albeit sometimes it can be a buggy experience, or it can lead to weird interactions with NPCs (really needs work).

"First Impressions were that the DLC was WAY too hard. I ended up walking away from some bosses to collect the items needed to become stronger and returning to the boss later, it paid off. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE. Anyone who leaves a negative review for difficulty is either just being ignorant or lazy. The Artwork, Cinematic work, Views, Weapons, Armour, Locations are all INCREDIBLE.

"2022 My advice at this point is to wait for the immortal empires release to see if this is worth playing.Pros-Relatively fun units, lords and faction mechanics.-The graphics are about what you would expect from a sequelCons-The campaign just fails on so many levels. 1) The actual campaign mechanics don't feel rewarding and are oftentimes more punishing as you progress. Realm of Chaos is just a torturous bore that doesn't really offer any reward and particularly in Tzeentch's realm its a crap shoot of racing the enemy AI and hoping you randomly choose the correct portal path. 2) Random warp portals. This is just monumentally frustrating and with limited armies can often lead to positions of you just hoping you've lucked out in having the appropriate forces in the right position if the AI goes for any kind of jankiness. Expect to waste an army or several dedicated to sitting in your important economic/production territories. This is particularly necessary if the AI decides to build up a few stacks before bumrushing a city.- City battles. The AI does not interact well with cities offense or defense. Units defending points that you aren't attacking or wandering units back and forth at random between points. -The AI in general is just... bad. Easily abuseable at all difficulties on the battle map and there are many times you will have to abuse it because the AI cheat stats at higher difficulties makes trying to play with basic tactics moot. i.e. spears/anti-large infantry don't really do anything to units they supposedly counter. Melee infantry is basically useless in the face of more ranged units. Regular cavalry units are generally not good. So basically the strat tends to wind down to hide the army exposing a single fast moving unit usually a lord and break the AI by luring out a unit at a time to pound into the dust via mass range spam/magic. (khorne has some leeway with the free armies they can spam out for disposable melee but yeah ultimately not a good time)-The campaign AI is just bad with the cheats to compete with the player. Also anti-player bias is hilarious watching the AI ignore 6 full stacks of another AI they are at war with to come barreling down at you the player's out of the way undefended minor settlement while they get utterly ransacked and it doesn't mean anything because the AI isn't playing under any of the constraints that the player has to deal with on the campaign map beyond movement.",advic point wait immort empir releas see worth playingprosrel fun unit lord faction mechanicsth graphic would expect sequelconsth campaign fail mani level actual campaign mechan dont feel reward oftentim punish progress realm chao tortur bore doesnt realli offer reward particularli tzeentch realm crap shoot race enemi ai hope randomli choos correct portal path random warp portal monument frustrat limit armi often lead posit hope youv luck appropri forc right posit ai goe kind janki expect wast armi sever dedic sit import economicproduct territori particularli necessari ai decid build stack bumrush citi citi battl ai interact well citi offens defens unit defend point arent attack wander unit back forth random point ai gener bad easili abus difficulti battl map mani time abus ai cheat stat higher difficulti make tri play basic tactic moot ie spearsantilarg infantri dont realli anyth unit supposedli counter mele infantri basic useless face rang unit regular cavalri unit gener good basic strat tend wind hide armi expos singl fast move unit usual lord break ai lure unit time pound dust via mass rang spammag khorn leeway free armi spam dispos mele yeah ultim good timeth campaign ai bad cheat compet player also antiplay bia hilari watch ai ignor full stack anoth ai war come barrel player way undefend minor settlement get utterli ransack doesnt mean anyth ai isnt play constraint player deal campaign map beyond movement

"Rise, Son of Guilliman After finishing the campaign I just had to write a review to get my thoughts down on paper, this review will contain no spoilers for the story, but will talk about themes, gameplay and performance. Together of course with an overall impression, to start things off. Space Marine 2 exceeded my expectations by a significant margin, this game is really, really fun to play. I've seen some other reviews talking about how the combat system is ""unforgiving"", but I can only say that I disagree. The fast paces melee / ranged blend is really satisfying once you figure out what works for you. I played the game on the second to highest difficulty for my first run so far, I had to adjust in the beginning but once I got over the hurdle, quite frankly I just saw myself improving and getting better at managing the fights. To an extent fights in this game feel reminiscent of those from DOOM, specifically Eternal. Every fight is a puzzle that you need to think creatively to solve together with staying on top of incoming attacks and positioning. Complaints about the AI are valid, but I didn't notice much in terms of them getting in the way of me having fun. Performance wise, I'm running on a fairly old rig, 1080 and an i7-4790k, and I got stable performance albeit not exceptional on the high preset. For me I am fine if a game runs at 30 as long as it is stable, and Space Marine 2 was, depending on level, either running at stable 30, stable 45, stable 60 or unstable 20-30. The 20-30 range being in some of the later where the game is really flexing it's muscle in terms of scale and the number of effects on screen. As for all the stuff with the Epic integration? Quite literally you accept the EULA and that's it. It has no other impact on your gameplay. I find complaints around this sort of stuff to be valid, if exaggerated. It is okay to be upset that this is ""forced"" upon you, but I do not think it warrants leaving a negative review for the game, personally. Story? This feels like it could've been a 40k novel. I say that with significant praise, compared to the first game the stakes are higher, the characters are better, and it just feels like a part of actual canon now. I am incredibly satisfied, and depending on how the game develops in the next few years, it might firmly take the spot for ""My personal favorite 40k game"", as it is now, however? Firmly top 3.Suffice to say, I strongly recommend this game, I will be diving into the multiplayer and co-op components in the next few days, and if there is anything to add or detract from this review, expect addenda :) If no addenda are found on this review, my stance holds firm.",rise son guilliman finish campaign write review get thought paper review contain spoiler stori talk theme gameplay perform togeth cours overal impress start thing space marin exceed expect signific margin game realli realli fun play ive seen review talk combat system unforgiv say disagre fast pace mele rang blend realli satisfi figur work play game second highest difficulti first run far adjust begin got hurdl quit frankli saw improv get better manag fight extent fight game feel reminisc doom specif etern everi fight puzzl need think creativ solv togeth stay top incom attack posit complaint ai valid didnt notic much term get way fun perform wise im run fairli old rig got stabl perform albeit except high preset fine game run long stabl space marin depend level either run stabl stabl stabl unstabl rang later game realli flex muscl term scale number effect screen stuff epic integr quit liter accept eula that impact gameplay find complaint around sort stuff valid exagger okay upset forc upon think warrant leav neg review game person stori feel like couldv novel say signific prais compar first game stake higher charact better feel like part actual canon incred satisfi depend game develop next year might firmli take spot person favorit game howev firmli top say strongli recommend game dive multiplay coop compon next day anyth add detract review expect addenda addenda found review stanc hold firm

"2023 This game feels like a corpse that's just being marionetted by a marketing team. I've tried desperately to like it, inhaling as much copium as I can because I bought so much of the DLC, particularly because I'm a big Warhammer fan and longtime total war fan. Its lost so much of what made total war a great franchise and its obvious that creative assembly isn't the same company that made the previous installments that brought total war to the forefront of strategy games.They rushed warhammer 3 out the door at least a year or so too early and it's clear their MO is to release half-baked games and never fix them. So many glitches and issues still plague this game which are too numerous to mention, with some still existing from the previous warhammer 2 installment. Some of these issues are egregious, with things like a legendary lord who specializes in a certain unit losing the ability to even recruit that unit for months after a patch, with the issue still being present at the time of this writing (though fixed by the incredible modding community that CA doesn't deserve). Their priority is to release the rest of the game as piecemealed DLCs, which for a time were just a bad value, have developed into basically a full on scam. Higher prices for less content and absolutely no care for taking time to iron out the many issues of the game first.It seems they have no intention on budging from this approach, just continuing to staple overpriced garbage onto the game, releasing ""patches"" that end up creating new issues, and overall just suffocating the game with a mountain of technical debt. Even if creative assembly releases a game that fans have been clamoring for, like Medieval 3, what's the point? It's just going to have the same issues that have marred the series for a long time, like poor AI and uninteresting sieges, while at the same time cranking up the level of greed with pricier DLCs and promises of ""fixing"" the game with vague roadmaps that they never follow. There is no more innovation, there is no more analyzation of what makes the core of total war fun and improving on that. It's just a total ♥♥♥♥ show. The drop of support for the three kingdoms game due to a lack of DLC purchases should have been a warning sign. What kind of an abusive game do they want players to take part in? You better buy our half-baked, overpriced DLCs or else we'll stop support for the game that we released in an unfinished state? But if you buy the DLCs, we'll just keep making more half-baked, overpriced DLCs and we won't actually bother to fix the game we released in an initial broken state? It seems like it's a lose-lose for the players, and frankly a spit in the face. There's better games out there that are worth your time and money, and this series isn't among them any longer.",game feel like corps that marionet market team ive tri desper like inhal much copium bought much dlc particularli im big warhamm fan longtim total war fan lost much made total war great franchis obviou creativ assembl isnt compani made previou instal brought total war forefront strategi gamesthey rush warhamm door least year earli clear mo releas halfbak game never fix mani glitch issu still plagu game numer mention still exist previou warhamm instal issu egregi thing like legendari lord special certain unit lose abil even recruit unit month patch issu still present time write though fix incred mod commun ca doesnt deserv prioriti releas rest game piecem dlc time bad valu develop basic full scam higher price less content absolut care take time iron mani issu game firstit seem intent budg approach continu stapl overpr garbag onto game releas patch end creat new issu overal suffoc game mountain technic debt even creativ assembl releas game fan clamor like mediev what point go issu mar seri long time like poor ai uninterest sieg time crank level greed pricier dlc promis fix game vagu roadmap never follow innov analyz make core total war fun improv total show drop support three kingdom game due lack dlc purchas warn sign kind abus game want player take part better buy halfbak overpr dlc els well stop support game releas unfinish state buy dlc well keep make halfbak overpr dlc wont actual bother fix game releas initi broken state seem like loselos player frankli spit face there better game worth time money seri isnt among longer

"2022 Personally I can't recommend the game in its current state right now, this review comes a fair time after launch and after some patches to fix certain issues/balancing with the game. I pre ordered the game and played on release; the amount of hours I have in the game (48.4 at the time of writing) speaks to how much fun i had with the title. While I know it's been changed now, the main campaign is utterly atrocious with its invasive mechanics and mind numbing realms of chaos mechanics (♥♥♥♥ YOU TZEENTCH RANDOM TELEPORTS), I don't know who thought this was a fun or good idea on the Dev side but it really neutered my enjoymnet of the game after my first play through.The game can legitimately be enjoyable, I won't pretend I've played every faction to a T or explored every nook and cranny of their tech/lord trees as we all have our own personal tastes; what I did play was fun for a bit, but it wore off very quickly. I think they did a superb job with numerous quality of life changes, but overall the game feels like a lesser package than WH2. You could indeed make the argument that WH2 has had years of DLC to accompany it and I'd agree, but if you compare WH1 to WH2 the quality difference compared to game 2-3 is staggering. I waited to make this review to give them time to iron out bugs/do balancing, but mostly wait for immortal Empires which is the big pull for the game, today we learned the BETA for it isn't coming out for another 3-6 months which at least to me is mind boggling. WH2 had ME out if i recall within a month or two, on one hand they're trying to make sure everything works smoothly before releasing it, on the other so many issues in game were so blatant I don't know how they weren't found in QA/playtesting/Beta, by the time content creators got their hands on it it wasn't realistic to expect such ingrained issues to be fixed by then. Lord defeat traits being a joke, some skill trees being a lackluster joke in comparison to others, tech trees also on the seesaw between being fun and engaging/a boring almost not noticeable change, hero traits also being neutered from WH2; it's sad.Overall I think it's an ok game, I'm just very disappointed and I feel bad for getting my friend excited to play it with me only for us to get bored in our co-op campaign within a week.

"2022 This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ disgrace which is saying a lot even for a CA game. I've literally never written a review but this game....oh boy this game, I'll make an exception for.2 long legendary campaigns (140 hours at time of writing and thousands on total war games in general) ended abruptly when I couldn't teleport to the *SPOILER* forge of souls to intercept the enemy. I literally got the prompt to go there so I did, and waited there for 10+ turns. No battle option ever came up and upon one of my turns completing was given 'you've failed to intercept, campaign lost'. Like seriously? Didn't have the option with BOTH campaigns. This isn't even an isolated issue. Search up 'forge of souls issue' and it feels like no ones able to finish a campaign. How did this garbage get past playtesting? Not to mention the Tzeentch faction mechanic of just pausing all your movement for a turn. You know what makes warhammer suck in real life? Uninteractable 'gotchas' that require no skill and you can't do ♥♥♥♥ about them. With normal overworld you can at least assasinate/wound heroes that try to block your movement. This is just a random frustration feature that adds nothing to gameplay Why would you give this to the ai when its not being used by a player? How does this enhance or add to the strategic play of the game when it randomly stops all your strategic movement EVERY 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TURNS, how can you be so oblivious to such an obviously trash and frustrating feature?Everyone who tells you they like minor settlement battles hasn't played 100000 of them on every campaign that isn't on toddler difficulty. Too long, nonsensical, too frequent, and autoresolve just sucks (t5 garrisons 'decisive loss' vs t1 unit rebel blobs. In battle itself - I have no idea if this is intentional but it is still trash of a mechanic-your units response times are like a dial up internet connection to china in 1990. I sincerely hope this is a me incident but compared to other total warhammer games or even total war games in general your units have terrible response times to commands. This could be another attempt at a 'feature' that just ends up being frustration inducing.'realism' dictates a lag in executing orders after receiving them but this is still a game. I'm not looking to fight my own units to go forwards. Maybe its to make it harder to dodge magic but just feels like meaningless lag added to piss you off. Speaking of further pissing someone off, missile units are worse than ever with pathfinding. hundreds of times i've had them shoot something literally in front of them with no impediments and not only will they not fire but they'll just run straight into melee. Other TW games had this issue too but never to this extent. Its too the point where I don't even want to issue attack orders with a line of missile troops because its so hard to have them shoot to begin with without having to micro all of them to not charge into them when its an unimpeded sight line to the target. I was super excited to try out cathays close range rifles until I realized they never fired at your target unless they were autotargeting. Its like they took everything good about the other TW WH games and just made them suck. Oh not to mention unit formations means ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when even the ai just decides to pull entire units through your ranks or a shieldwall to touch your archers or artillery.With crap mechanics and unstable gameplay, I wouldn't touch this game until a couple years after launch and they remove the stupid mechanics they added. There are improvements to diplomacy like allegiance income and trading settlements, but fudnamentally, this game feels clunky, unresponsive, and is frustrating to play.Wait till patches fix everything.",game disgrac say lot even ca game ive liter never written review gameoh boy game ill make except long legendari campaign hour time write thousand total war game gener end abruptli couldnt teleport spoiler forg soul intercept enemi liter got prompt go wait turn battl option ever came upon one turn complet given youv fail intercept campaign lost like serious didnt option campaign isnt even isol issu search forg soul issu feel like one abl finish campaign garbag get past playtest mention tzeentch faction mechan paus movement turn know make warhamm suck real life uninteract gotcha requir skill cant normal overworld least assasinatewound hero tri block movement random frustrat featur add noth gameplay would give ai use player enhanc add strateg play game randomli stop strateg movement everi turn oblivi obvious trash frustrat featureeveryon tell like minor settlement battl hasnt play everi campaign isnt toddler difficulti long nonsens frequent autoresolv suck garrison decis loss vs unit rebel blob battl idea intent still trash mechanicyour unit respons time like dial internet connect china sincer hope incid compar total warhamm game even total war game gener unit terribl respons time command could anoth attempt featur end frustrat inducingr dictat lag execut order receiv still game im look fight unit go forward mayb make harder dodg magic feel like meaningless lag ad piss speak piss someon missil unit wors ever pathfind hundr time ive shoot someth liter front impedi fire theyll run straight mele tw game issu never extent point dont even want issu attack order line missil troop hard shoot begin without micro charg unimped sight line target super excit tri cathay close rang rifl realiz never fire target unless autotarget like took everyth good tw wh game made suck oh mention unit format mean even ai decid pull entir unit rank shieldwal touch archer artillerywith crap mechan unstabl gameplay wouldnt touch game coupl year launch remov stupid mechan ad improv diplomaci like allegi incom trade settlement fudnament game feel clunki unrespons frustrat playwait till patch fix everyth

"First off, this game has been an absolute joy to play. The story missions are fantastic, and the cinematics really enhance the experience. The way the operations work in tandem with the missions is also impressive. I highly recommend tackling the story missions in order with the operations; doing all the operations first can spoil the storyline.I’ve maxed out two classes and can comfortably handle the hardest difficulty with ease. While the PvP aspect is a bit slow-paced by design and I haven’t invested many hours into it, it hasn’t been particularly engaging.Unfortunately, I’m nearing the end of my time with the game, aside from maxing out a few more classes and helping friends. I really hope they add another couple of difficulties beyond the upcoming lethal mode, as well as some extra challenging enemies during missions. I wish I could experience the first 15 hours of the game again.Replayability is somewhat lacking due to the limited number of operations and the absence of significant challenges once you reach level 15 on any class. The excitement starts to wane after completing the story and operations.It’s also disappointing that the horde mode isn’t coming until 2025. However, I would definitely recommend this game. Just don’t expect it to be a staple in your gaming routine; once you’ve completed the story and operations, there isn’t much left to keep you engaged.Overall, I’d give it a 9/10. ❤️",first game absolut joy play stori mission fantast cinemat realli enhanc experi way oper work tandem mission also impress highli recommend tackl stori mission order oper oper first spoil storylin max two class comfort handl hardest difficulti eas pvp aspect bit slowpac design havent invest mani hour hasnt particularli engagingunfortun im near end time game asid max class help friend realli hope add anoth coupl difficulti beyond upcom lethal mode well extra challeng enemi mission wish could experi first hour game againreplay somewhat lack due limit number oper absenc signific challeng reach level class excit start wane complet stori operationsit also disappoint hord mode isnt come howev would definit recommend game dont expect stapl game routin youv complet stori oper isnt much left keep engagedoveral id give

"2023 Switching this to a positive for now. CA have made big strides in bug fixing and the amount of content they put in DLCs. Thrones of Decay is night and day compared to Shadows of change with a ton of free content on the side. Bugs that have been around for years - e.g. pursuing routing units being wonky, range LoS not working, artillery not spreading shots etc - have been fixed. The price point of the DLC is still quite high but its no longer applied to a broken game and what you get is excellent.Old negative review below.---I loved this trilogy - well over 1k hours between the 3 games, but CA have burnt all goodwill in 2 ways:1) Glacial pace and low quality of patching. Very basic features which have been reported multiple times over years have been left unaddressed and ignored. Community bugfixes which changed one line of code have fixed some of these problems, but CA have done nothing.2) Lord pack pricing moving from £7.99 - > £19.99 for a similar amount of content is bananas. There is no justifiable reason for this level of price hike, especially considering the poor support WH3 has received in its lifecycle. And this is from someone who happily paid for the increased price of the Chaos Dwarfs.If these two problems get addressed it can possibly move to a thumbs up, but right now, this is unacceptable.",switch posit ca made big stride bug fix amount content put dlc throne decay night day compar shadow chang ton free content side bug around year eg pursu rout unit wonki rang lo work artilleri spread shot etc fix price point dlc still quit high longer appli broken game get excellentold neg review belowi love trilog well hour game ca burnt goodwil glacial pace low qualiti patch basic featur report multipl time year left unaddress ignor commun bugfix chang one line code fix problem ca done lord pack price move similar amount content banana justifi reason level price hike especi consid poor support receiv lifecycl someon happili paid increas price chao dwarfsif two problem get address possibl move thumb right unaccept
"Update to my review. I have to give this a thumbs down now. Its a great game, it really is. But it is RUINED by the insane loading times (I have gig up and down speeds) and that you are FORCED to play with others. If you disconnect your internet, you can play with bots, but it doesnt save ANY of that progress even though you get STEAM accomplishments while offline. It makes ZERO sense. Then there are the skins. While some of them are cool, most are simply just different colors of the exact same armor. Its like the Devs think Space Marines are clones or something. They are meant to be UNIQUE, not cookie cutter. This plague of gaming where folks are forced to be online to play single player games will be the death of PC gaming. This along with the non stop need to have account after account just to play a game is getting plain ridiculous. If you are a 40k fan pick it up purely for the campaign which is EPIC and amazing. The rest of the game is a complete letdown.",updat review give thumb great game realli ruin insan load time gig speed forc play other disconnect internet play bot doesnt save progress even though get steam accomplish offlin make zero sens skin cool simpli differ color exact armor like dev think space marin clone someth meant uniqu cooki cutter plagu game folk forc onlin play singl player game death pc game along non stop need account account play game get plain ridicul fan pick pure campaign epic amaz rest game complet letdown

"2022 I want to give this a good review and I know for a fact im gonna switch it over later but for now id hold off on this game a bit. The main gamemode they have going is really neat at first and I like that they added a story kinda but there is no mortal empires or anything. Having to basically stay in your own little area because the chaos rifts open and just attack your settlements so your constantly playing defensive just isnt really that fun. Plus if your like me and like to take ages to build up your bases and build up only 2 or 3 really op armies, by the time you get them some other faction wins the game and its just over. You cant continue after or anything. Thats it you lose and it boots you out lol. But yeah hopefully mortal empires is added soon so it will be more enjoyable.",want give good review know fact im gon na switch later id hold game bit main gamemod go realli neat first like ad stori kinda mortal empir anyth basic stay littl area chao rift open attack settlement constantli play defens isnt realli fun plu like like take age build base build realli op armi time get faction win game cant continu anyth that lose boot lol yeah hope mortal empir ad soon enjoy

"2022 The QoL changes from WH2 to WH3 are enough to reccomend this game on their own. The improvements to alliances, sieges, corruption are all very welcome additions. This isn't quite the same leap as between TWWH1 & 2, but still very nice improvements The new factions while a bit barebones at the moment, are all excellent both in variety between them and in how well they match the flavour of their factions. The Daemon Prince in particular is an excellent achievement I really enjoyed. It seems for this game CA have really invested in immersing in the Warhammer world, to an even greater extent than in the other 2 games in the series. For example the campaign map now has little icons you can hover over to get some lore information about particular sites of interest throughout the world. Which makes it even more surprising that the lore bits of previous games - Lord quests and Landmark building - seem to have been scaled back a lot. There are very few landmarks of any kind and the quests are no longer multi-stage with you having to perform several tasks to get to the end goal. I have not done all of them yet, but the ones I have done have consisted of ""get to level X and fight a battle"" with little justification for the battle and no preparatory steps beforehand. There is a caveat however. As it stands WH3 is much more strongly narratively driven than any Total War game there has been before, including WH2. The campaign is constrained by the story (though not to the extent others have said, it is perfectly possible to have a large Empire and constant expansion). 1.1 has added the ability to ignore the story to an extent but you still have to play around it even if you don't engage with it. This is not an issue for me, I enjoy a different approach to a Total War campaign than the usual paint the map Empire building and having to work within the bounds of the narrative comes with its own challenges and difficulties. In particular a lot of the mechanics serve as anti-snowball features; the larger your Empire the more intrusive these mechanics become so the late-game stage of previous total wars where you are no longer threatened by anyone and just finishing off the map painting is harder to achieve. However many longtime Total War fans are not enjoying the different direction of the main campaign and the constraints on playstyle.As of writing there is no roadmap or timeline for future expansions. The ""Immortal Empires"" campaign, a combined map of all 3 games including all the factions is coming at some point (hopefully soon) and will introduce a much larger and more sandbox mode, so if a ""normal"" Total War experience is what you are after I would wait until this mode is out. This mode also requires you to own all 3 Total War games on the same platform (Steam, Epic etc.) which is a lot of investment for someone new to the series.There are also quite a number of bugs, some game-breaking, others just annoying. These are being actively worked on and based on the experience with other TW games a lot of these will be ironed out in time. I have played 6 campaigns now and only one of them has broken to the point I had to abandon it but others have all had little irritants. I have still played nearly 300 hours in 2 months though, so clearly these bugs do not overly diminish the fun I have had with the game.Performance has been a bit of an issue for me as well. WH2 I played on Ultra settings for everything and only occassionally had a slowdown very late into the campaign. WH3 I am still able to play on Ultra settings, and the battles function at a good framerate, but the campaign map starts struggling to keep up from ~turn 50 onwards, with long pauses while it figures something out and frequent frame drops.Battle has some oddities. With 1.1. cavalry feel better than they have in any other entry in the series, and infantry are more responsive but there are still issues with infantry movement and ranged unit targeting when ordered. 1.1 was a large improvement and it looks like CA are still working on ironing out the issues. For the most part battles feel essentially the same as in WH2, though the AI does seem to have been improved. For example in WH2 the AI would always attempt to flank with their cavalry. This involved swinging cavalry out to the wings then charging into the flanks. If you placed units covering the flanks the AI would more often than not just charge into the covering unit, regardless of if that was a good matchup for them. In WH3 enemy cavalry will continue to move around and position themselves until they find a good angle to attack. They will move around your anti-large units and go for your artillery or missile units instead. There are still issues with the AI recognising that just because it is considered the defender doesn't mean standing still and waiting is the best tactic, but overall it feels much more intelligent than WH2. The AI struggles with the new sieges a little, never seeming to make up its mind whether it wants to fight or cap points, leading to it not doing either very efficiently. Additionally pathfinding in settlements can be pretty difficult. The AI does make fairly good use of the new supplies mechanic (though it cheats a bit on cooldown times and rarely if ever builds higher-tier towers, preferring to spam out the cheaper lower-tier ones), which is nice to see.The new ""survival battles"" are very nice and provide a good variety for the player. However they are LONG and draining. They can be autoresolved, aside from the last one which is good because sometimes I am just not up for the effort a survival battle takes, however auto-resolve is very punishing on the higher difficulties, so you can end up in a bit of a lose-lose when coming up to one of these.In short:Pros: Many QoL features that are improvements over TW2 New factions are excellent More immersive in Warhammer universe than the previous 2 games AI improvements (For me) The narrative-driven campaign forcing new playstyles and new solutions to issuesCons: Long-time fans are not enjoying the main campaign story Some bugs Some battle quirks that need fixing Performance issuesI rate this game 8/10 as it currently stands, and I have little doubt that number will rise as more patches and expansions come to the game",qol chang enough reccomend game improv allianc sieg corrupt welcom addit isnt quit leap still nice improv new faction bit barebon moment excel varieti well match flavour faction daemon princ particular excel achiev realli enjoy seem game ca realli invest immers warhamm world even greater extent game seri exampl campaign map littl icon hover get lore inform particular site interest throughout world make even surpris lore bit previou game lord quest landmark build seem scale back lot landmark kind quest longer multistag perform sever task get end goal done yet one done consist get level x fight battl littl justif battl preparatori step beforehand caveat howev stand much strongli narr driven total war game includ campaign constrain stori though extent other said perfectli possibl larg empir constant expans ad abil ignor stori extent still play around even dont engag issu enjoy differ approach total war campaign usual paint map empir build work within bound narr come challeng difficulti particular lot mechan serv antisnowbal featur larger empir intrus mechan becom lategam stage previou total war longer threaten anyon finish map paint harder achiev howev mani longtim total war fan enjoy differ direct main campaign constraint playstylea write roadmap timelin futur expans immort empir campaign combin map game includ faction come point hope soon introduc much larger sandbox mode normal total war experi would wait mode mode also requir total war game platform steam epic etc lot invest someon new seriesther also quit number bug gamebreak other annoy activ work base experi tw game lot iron time play campaign one broken point abandon other littl irrit still play nearli hour month though clearli bug overli diminish fun gameperform bit issu well play ultra set everyth occassion slowdown late campaign still abl play ultra set battl function good framer campaign map start struggl keep turn onward long paus figur someth frequent frame dropsbattl odditi cavalri feel better entri seri infantri respons still issu infantri movement rang unit target order larg improv look like ca still work iron issu part battl feel essenti though ai seem improv exampl ai would alway attempt flank cavalri involv swing cavalri wing charg flank place unit cover flank ai would often charg cover unit regardless good matchup enemi cavalri continu move around posit find good angl attack move around antilarg unit go artilleri missil unit instead still issu ai recognis consid defend doesnt mean stand still wait best tactic overal feel much intellig ai struggl new sieg littl never seem make mind whether want fight cap point lead either effici addit pathfind settlement pretti difficult ai make fairli good use new suppli mechan though cheat bit cooldown time rare ever build higherti tower prefer spam cheaper lowerti one nice seeth new surviv battl nice provid good varieti player howev long drain autoresolv asid last one good sometim effort surviv battl take howev autoresolv punish higher difficulti end bit loselos come one thesein shortpro mani qol featur improv new faction excel immers warhamm univers previou game ai improv narrativedriven campaign forc new playstyl new solut issuescon longtim fan enjoy main campaign stori bug battl quirk need fix perform issuesi rate game current stand littl doubt number rise patch expans come game

"2022 Builds upon the formula of Dark Souls III with new ways to approach combat such as sneaking, jumping, and mounted combat. The world is huge, with lots of interesting enemies and NPCs to encounter. Replay value will likely be a strong point for this game as there are plenty of new spells and weapons. Some animations and assets have been recycled from previous games, but there is enough new stuff to make it feel like a new experience. Performance can be rough at times, though the team has been rolling out patches to mitigate these issues. Co-op seems to be basically copied from Dark Souls III, except the item used to host a session is much easier to obtain. I'd really like to see them make some design improvements allowing for players to co-op in an area even after the boss has been defeated, similar to the small white soapstone in Dark Souls II. Overall, I've had a lot of fun with the game so far, and expect to experiment with new builds in New Game+ for many hours.",build upon formula dark soul iii new way approach combat sneak jump mount combat world huge lot interest enemi npc encount replay valu like strong point game plenti new spell weapon anim asset recycl previou game enough new stuff make feel like new experi perform rough time though team roll patch mitig issu coop seem basic copi dark soul iii except item use host session much easier obtain id realli like see make design improv allow player coop area even boss defeat similar small white soapston dark soul ii overal ive lot fun game far expect experi new build new game mani hour

"Definitely DO NOT recommend this.I've grown up on a large variety of games, and this game suffers from bad pacing and design.You need a 4080 to play because I've found the input lag unbearable. From technical reviews like Digital Foundry, you *must* turn off frame generation and other settings (global illum, shadows, anti-aliasing, etc) because these cause significant input delay. Why buy a game costing $94 only to kill visual settings?? Its optimization is shockingly bad when other visually stunning games run well. Warframe, Doom Eternal, Elden Ring, etc are all examples of fast-paced gorgeous games at over 200fps on older systems. Act 1 unfortunately runs past 2 hours so by the time these issues become apparent, I can't get a refund.Key problems:1) Buggy input queues for spirits, transformation, and medicines. Sometimes I must keep tapping the button to trigger usage. Sometimes a light tap interrupts my attack combo instead of queuing up. Sometimes nothing happens after spamming repeatedly and I'm standing around while the boss is waiting in the background weirdly.2) Dodge mechanic very inconsistent. e.g. I've managed to dodge bosses OHKO attack, but after repeated experiments, it's inconsistent. The perfect dodge mechanic also doesn't trigger consistently. It feels like you inconsistently have a larger hitbox.3) Horrifically bad camera angles. Most games have an ""greasy camera slide"" algorithm to detect obstructions between the player and camera origin. It auto-moves the camera. In this game, I got stuck behind a pillar or tree or bush until I'm dead. Also, they did not notice to zoom out on the camera for mega-boss stages, so you're often looking between Wukong's legs or the earth.4) Inconsistent stage design. In act 1, the game has shrines right before main bosses. Later on, you must run back across entire stages to get back to a boss. If you die many times... Good luck.5) Toxic community. Astroturfing by China fanboys makes it impossible to get help or raise attention to the devs for fixes. No dissent is allowed. Everything else is downvoted or harrassed. You can't even make recommendations on tuning graphic settings. Even asking to tune down the difficulty traps you into needless arguments about how to get good. It's amazing how rude they are to older adults with jobs and kids, but still want to enjoy the story.Devs have not communicated on improving the game. Best to wait for actual substantial updates before making a purchase.-----------------28 Aug 2024Made it into act 4. Act 3 is easily 3 times larger than act 1 and 2, which is extremely tedious. Invisible walls everywhere. Many corners look like they can be explored, but are dead ends with no visual design to prevent us from wasting time. You can't interact with the environment unlike Genshin Impact. There's no flying. No wall climbing. Even warframe, a FREE game, I can bullet jump and wall latch. The movement here makes the monkey king look lame.Boss fights in act 3 were also lame. You dance between the boss legs, so your camera is always twitching between his legs and floor. The company calls itself Game Science, claiming to be a serious science and engineering studio... But learned no lessons by GOTY games over the past decade for such things.After unlocking most skills, the game play is also... boring. A few enemies have long attack chains, yet you must keep dodging because upgraded attacks cannot disrupt them. Thus, Dodge Fest Simulator.So you'll cheese it by charging up thrust stance right? That's even more boring. You can't spam magic as magic does NOT recharge until you get special gourd much later. So you have to save your spells and transformation by cheesing through the entire stageORbe forced tododgedodgedodgedodgebecause enemies cannot be interrupted without charged heavy attacks. So keep dodging until your focal points are enough to heavy attack. Then repeat dodging.Finally, the story?It's as if the devs have never studied their own culture or history. The reasons that I love Journey to the West, even studied asian religions and philosophies in university, was because of the deeply respectful and profound allegorical discourses absent from other civilisations. From a story writing perspective, this is important. 3000+ years of profound and rich source material exists for story writers.There's an abundance to create a beautiful cast of characters, each with deep complex portrayals that could have made the story profoundly moving. But none of that was seen.""Journey to the West"" was written at a time (circa 1592) when Buddhism had thrived in a huge sprawling dynastic empire (circa Tang Dynasty 618-907). Before Buddhism came (circa BCE 206), Shamanism, rich regional folk lore, Taoism (circa BCE 450), Confucius (circa BCE 551, Hundred Schools of Thought era), and all manner of secular sects were already deeply rooted. ""Journey to the West"" is a rare culmination of allegorical novel writing popular over centuries. Yet, none of this was used in game.Instead, the characters are shallow and lacking depth. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are liars neglecting vows. Celestial court is full of superficial violent immortals. Humans are weak animals at their mercy. Demons are always evil because it is their birth nature. The profound essence of China's culture no longer exists in the game. Like China cities today, all that exists in the game is a beautiful facade. What is China culture?In the original novel, countless profound moments exist. The one I love is about the length of their journey in chapter 24:""你自小时走到老，老了再小，老小千番也还难。只要你见性志诚，念念回首处，即是灵山。""""You can walk from young till old, from old till young again, and even for 1000 cycles, it would still be difficult (to reach the end of your journey). But once you truly achieve the resolute perception (of wisdom), (realising that) Buddha-nature (exists) in all things, then you will have immediately arrived at Spirit Mountain (at the end of your journey).""There are countless lines of beautiful prose and poetry peppered across the original novel.Moments when loyalty and brotherhood stand in contrast to easy victories and unscrupulous tactics. Moments when you realise, for all of Wukong's fiery temper and violence, he is a person that deeply cares about doing the right thing with a deep penetrating wisdom that cuts through the commonly accepted social beliefs. Disappointingly, all of that. Gone. Lost.All we have left is a beautiful spectacle mired by aggressive toxic fanboys and a superficial court (studio)?Maybe this is the ultimate allegory; spiritual successor in the lamentation of modern China. 表面美化，盖掉缺点，心中百烂。Maybe that is the true intent of the game developers.",definit recommend thisiv grown larg varieti game game suffer bad pace designy need play ive found input lag unbear technic review like digit foundri must turn frame gener set global illum shadow antialias etc caus signific input delay buy game cost kill visual set optim shockingli bad visual stun game run well warfram doom etern elden ring etc exampl fastpac gorgeou game older system act unfortun run past hour time issu becom appar cant get refundkey buggi input queue spirit transform medicin sometim must keep tap button trigger usag sometim light tap interrupt attack combo instead queu sometim noth happen spam repeatedli im stand around boss wait background dodg mechan inconsist eg ive manag dodg boss ohko attack repeat experi inconsist perfect dodg mechan also doesnt trigger consist feel like inconsist larger horrif bad camera angl game greasi camera slide algorithm detect obstruct player camera origin automov camera game got stuck behind pillar tree bush im dead also notic zoom camera megaboss stage your often look wukong leg inconsist stage design act game shrine right main boss later must run back across entir stage get back boss die mani time good toxic commun astroturf china fanboy make imposs get help rais attent dev fix dissent allow everyth els downvot harrass cant even make recommend tune graphic set even ask tune difficulti trap needless argument get good amaz rude older adult job kid still want enjoy storydev commun improv game best wait actual substanti updat make aug act act easili time larger act extrem tediou invis wall everywher mani corner look like explor dead end visual design prevent us wast time cant interact environ unlik genshin impact there fli wall climb even warfram free game bullet jump wall latch movement make monkey king look lameboss fight act also lame danc boss leg camera alway twitch leg floor compani call game scienc claim seriou scienc engin studio learn lesson goti game past decad thingsaft unlock skill game play also bore enemi long attack chain yet must keep dodg upgrad attack disrupt thu dodg fest simulatorso youll chees charg thrust stanc right that even bore cant spam magic magic recharg get special gourd much later save spell transform chees entir stageorb forc tododgedodgedodgedodgebecaus enemi interrupt without charg heavi attack keep dodg focal point enough heavi attack repeat dodgingfin storyit dev never studi cultur histori reason love journey west even studi asian religion philosophi univers deepli respect profound allegor discours absent civilis stori write perspect import year profound rich sourc materi exist stori writersther abund creat beauti cast charact deep complex portray could made stori profoundli move none seenjourney west written time circa buddhism thrive huge sprawl dynast empir circa tang dynasti buddhism came circa bce shaman rich region folk lore taoism circa bce confuciu circa bce hundr school thought era manner secular sect alreadi deepli root journey west rare culmin allegor novel write popular centuri yet none use gameinstead charact shallow lack depth buddha bodhisattva liar neglect vow celesti court full superfici violent immort human weak anim merci demon alway evil birth natur profound essenc china cultur longer exist game like china citi today exist game beauti facad china culturein origin novel countless profound moment exist one love length journey chapter walk young till old old till young even cycl would still difficult reach end journey truli achiev resolut percept wisdom realis buddhanatur exist thing immedi arriv spirit mountain end journeyther countless line beauti prose poetri pepper across origin novelmo loyalti brotherhood stand contrast easi victori unscrupul tactic moment realis wukong fieri temper violenc person deepli care right thing deep penetr wisdom cut commonli accept social belief disappointingli gone lostal left beauti spectacl mire aggress toxic fanboy superfici court studiomayb ultim allegori spiritu successor lament modern china mayb true intent game develop
"2022 A Dark Fantasy for the Ages...» Elden Ring is an absolute masterpiece, having mastered the art of showing without telling. It is vastly different from other open-world games I have experienced such as The Witcher 3 and Skyrim, which are story and questline driven. From the get-go, Elden Ring does not impose any particular playstyle or route on you. You are completely free to do what you want to from the very start of the game. You can finish the main storyline and beat the final boss, or you can explore the entire map without ever seeing the main bosses. It truly is up to you with no outside influence. This sense of freedom in choice and exploration in any open-world game is refreshing.Not to mention, Elden Ring has also mastered the art of subtlety. For example, for a game like Skyrim, there are various elements such as the character dialogues, leveling system, and various landmarks that I could clearly point to in contributing to the game's success. However, this is not the case here. It is hard to place a finger on one specific thing that makes Elden Ring so enjoyable. Many times I have gone in to play this game for half an hour, only to become immersed, losing track of time and playing for hours on end. I believe that the game's features, i.e. the combat system, transportation, landscape, lore, storytelling, etc., complement each other in a way that none of them are overbearing. At the same time, these elements come together in such a fluid manner that I, as the player, cannot notice it and am drawn into a level of immersion that I have not felt from any game before.Environment» This game has one of the most enormous and intricately detailed worlds I have ever seen in gaming. I have not had a single moment where the map felt desolate or empty; there was always something to see and explore. The castles, cities, and fortresses that you must traverse in this game are truly awe-inspiring. They are all massive, unique, and filled with a plethora of secret areas just waiting to be uncovered. The landscapes of the world are also astonishing. The sheer variety and scale of the environments are a sight to behold. Players can expect to explore vast mountains, forests, fields, deep caves, ancient ruins, and even hidden underground civilizations. It is clear that a great amount of work went into the design of all of these areas, as they are all exceptionally detailed and have complex lore, realism, and beauty to them that makes them a joy to explore.Combat» The combat in this game is utterly masterful, blending elements from many of FromSoftware's previous works including Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne, and Sekiro to create an extremely tense, fluid, and customizable combat system. The amount of variety in terms of different playstyles, build variation, and weapon types are enough to make the combat in this game endlessly enjoyable.You also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous souls game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill.The Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say you find a really good rapier and like the moveset, but are building your character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If you find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, you can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if you eventually decide to re-spec into a different build, you can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons.Bosses» The boss roster of Elden Ring is also extremely difficult and unforgettable. Most of the boss battles are remarkably challenging, rich with lore, and breathtaking. The complex fighting style of the bosses cannot be overlooked. Many of the bosses have extremely intricate, fast, and punishing attacks that are both tough to avoid and fun to fight against. This makes the battles against the bosses feel like a dance, as you rhythmically dodge their devastating combo attacks before finding small windows to go on the offensive. This is nothing new, as this style of boss encounter is exactly what the Dark Souls series pioneered. However, Elden Ring perfects this age-old formula by giving the bosses bigger movesets, greater speed, and more complex combos than ever before. Some of the bosses can hammer you with 10-hit long combos with little margin for error, and the player must master a boss' moveset if they ever hope to come out on top. When you combine this with the grotesquely stunning visual design, you get some of the tensest and most engaging boss battles in history.On top of all this, the epic scope of the boss encounters and vast areas is further heightened by Elden Ring's stellar musical score. It perfectly conveys the emotional connection that you should have with whichever boss you are fighting. Many of the soundtracks in this game are utterly blood-pumping in a way that few other video games can match.Conclusion» Overall, in my opinion, Elden Ring more than lives up to the enormous hype surrounding it, proving to be one of the most memorable, challenging, and complex gaming experiences of the last century.Score: 9.8/10Was this review helpful?» If so, please leave a rating.

"2023 Absolutely insulting and disgusting pricing policy by CA for their latest DLC. But, that in and of itself shouldn't be a problem for the base game, right? So why is the review negative?Simple, CA has effectively abandoned this game for the last year. They worked half-heartedly at fixing the most glaring issues but have, time and time again, utterly failed to keep their words on bug fixes, blatantly lied about maintaining a sufficient number of devs working on this project, tried to pacify the community by releasing roadmaps they have no intention (or ability) to follow, and overall left the game in a lacking state. Just to mention one among the countless issues, is absolutely unacceptable that people who PAID to buy the Nakai DLC (not me btw) cannot recruit Kroxigors, you know, the SINGLE UNIT HE'S SUPPOSED TO USE THE MOST. To call that embarrassing would be an understatement.CA has worked hard to destroy any remaining goodwill they had left after the disastrous launch of this game, and absolutely deserves to get what's coming to them, including but not limited to, low sales and abysmal player retention. Hopefully, the community's effort will make them understand that a change of attitude towards this game is in order. Personally though, I hold little hope.The total war community desperately needs a competitor to bust into the scene and light a fire under CA's sorry buttocks.",absolut insult disgust price polici ca latest dlc shouldnt problem base game right review negativesimpl ca effect abandon game last year work halfheartedli fix glare issu time time utterli fail keep word bug fix blatantli lie maintain suffici number dev work project tri pacifi commun releas roadmap intent abil follow overal left game lack state mention one among countless issu absolut unaccept peopl paid buy nakai dlc btw recruit kroxigor know singl unit he suppos use call embarrass would understatementca work hard destroy remain goodwil left disastr launch game absolut deserv get what come includ limit low sale abysm player retent hope commun effort make understand chang attitud toward game order person though hold littl hopeth total war commun desper need competitor bust scene light fire ca sorri buttock
"Product received for free Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – A Brutal War in the Grim Darkness of the Future! (ฅ'ω'ฅ)""An exhilarating, gory, and action-packed sequel that lives up to the scale of the Warhammer 40K universe, but with some notable flaws in balance and technical polish.""[1] Intro : Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 thrusts players into the brutal and unrelenting world of the Warhammer 40K universe, continuing the tale of the Ultramarine Captain Demetrian Titus. Developed by Saber Interactive, this third-person action game places you in the superhuman armor of a Space Marine as you combat the horrifying Tyranid swarm in intense, blood-soaked battles. Building on the success of its predecessor, Space Marine 2 offers solo and co-op gameplay, featuring both player-versus-environment (PvE) and player-versus-player (PvP) modes to keep the action fresh and chaotic.[2] Game Experience : The moment you step into Titus' power armor, the scale of Space Marine 2’s combat becomes apparent. The game’s standout feature is its seamless combination of gunplay and melee combat, allowing players to switch between devastating bolter shots and brutal close-quarters executions. The spectacle of mowing down endless Tyranid swarms is both thrilling and terrifying, thanks to the sheer number of enemies onscreen, powered by Saber’s Swarm Engine.The visuals are equally impressive, capturing the grim, gothic aesthetic of the 40K universe. From the ruined hive cities to the expansive battlefields littered with the corpses of xenos and humans alike, the game never shies away from its dark atmosphere. The orchestral score and guttural sounds of bolters firing and chainswords revving heighten the sense of chaos, making every battle feel cinematic.However, the combat system, while exhilarating, does suffer from balance issues. Melee attacks dominate the battlefield, often making ranged weapons feel underpowered, particularly when faced with larger enemies. The tactical depth you'd expect from wielding the mighty bolter or plasma gun is somewhat diminished by their lack of punch, especially when it inexplicably takes a full magazine to down a basic Tyranid warrior. This can lead to frustrating moments, especially for players who prefer a ranged combat style.The co-op and PvP modes are a welcome addition, extending the game’s replayability. Operations, the co-op missions, allow players to team up with friends to tackle harder challenges, but the real test comes in the PvP mode, Eternal War, where teams of Space Marines face off against the forces of Chaos. Both modes offer progression systems with plenty of unlockable perks and cosmetics, though the limited variety in mission design can make long play sessions feel repetitive.[3] Pros and Cons : (+) Pros Incredible Atmosphere: The game nails the Warhammer 40K vibe with dark, grim visuals and an immersive soundscape. Fast-Paced Combat: The combat system is brutal, fast, and satisfying, especially for fans of melee action. Co-op and PvP Modes: Operations and Eternal War offer extensive replay value, particularly when played with friends. Enemy Variety: The Tyranids and Chaos forces present varied and challenging foes with unique behaviors and attack patterns.(-) Cons Weapon Imbalance: Ranged weapons often feel underpowered, making melee combat the dominant strategy. Technical Issues: Bugs, including floating objects and texture pop-ins, disrupt the immersion. Weightless Power Armor: The lack of impact when moving in power armor detracts from the feeling of being a superhuman warrior. Co-op Limitations: Progress in co-op isn’t always saved for non-host players, leading to frustration for those playing the campaign with friends.[4] Final Thoughts : Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 delivers on its promise of fast, bloody, and exhilarating combat in the vast and unforgiving Warhammer 40K universe. The game’s atmospheric design, gripping story, and expansive multiplayer modes make it a must-play for fans of the franchise and action games alike. However, the imbalance between melee and ranged combat, along with some technical glitches, prevent it from reaching its full potential.For those who love diving into the lore of Warhammer or who are looking for a gory, action-packed co-op experience, Space Marine 2 is a solid recommendation. Just don’t expect a perfectly polished experience or to rely heavily on your bolter.[5] Side Note : Nyanco Channel?

"2022 I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",yo father probabl one oldest peopl play game singl father son son got game christma uncl instal comput start play end week hour game horribl alreadi hard find way spend time son alway friend watch youtub decid make steam account get game see could mayb play alongsid load game pick charact world start play stuck suppos ask son help host game join love best time spent son sinc wife die game ever sinc brought son closer actual spend time togeth outsid hous togeth well game remind there fun everyth brought son mani happi memori

"A Kaleidoscope Of FunOnce Human invites players into a world fraught with fear, where lifeless objects reanimate into hostile creatures intent on human extinction. Guided by an otherworldly figure, players must battle formidable boss-type enemies to edge closer to a prospective salvation, which remains uncertain. Amidst these dangers, bonds of friendship and camaraderie strengthen among the inhabitants. Forging new armors and weapons enhances survivability, erecting walls and defenses safeguards against threats, and collecting Deviations (the game’s equivalent of Pokémon) advances players into adept survivalists.GameplayThe core gameplay of Once Human revolves around survival-craft, with a primary focus on resource gathering. This aspect is well-balanced, avoiding an excessively grindy feel. Base building epitomizes this balance, as creating a fully furnished home requires only a few hours of resource gathering and planning.Crafting is efficient, with most recipes completing in seconds. Bulk crafting takes only a few minutes, providing time to manage the base or review character skills and stats. Various methods to expedite and increase the yield of crafting items cater to those with limited patience.Deviations, the game’s Pokémon-esque companions, are found through quests or at the end of boss levels. They serve various roles, from crafting and gathering resources to combat. Unlike its contemporary Palworld, which offers numerous companions, Once Human makes them rarer, enhancing their impact. Players are encouraged to experiment to find the Deviation that best suits their playstyle.Gunplay is satisfying, encouraging players to seek cover and capitalize on attack opportunities. While reminiscent of The Division, it is less complex. Combat includes a dodge-roll, frequently used in boss fights and player skirmishes. Smooth animations add weight to actions, showcasing the development team’s attention to detail.Quests are scattered throughout the world, with main quests guiding the narrative and side quests rewarding players with Deviations, experience points, and resources. Various world quests incite the server’s population to either collaborate or compete for victory and rewards. PvP enthusiasts will appreciate the forced-PvP high-value locations, akin to The Division’s “Dark Zone.”Areas for ImprovementAs a new game, Once Human has a few bugs, though none cause crashes. Visual glitches, such as weapons not appearing in hands or enemies teleporting when stuck in walls, are noticeable. These issues are likely to be addressed in future updates.While crafting is generally balanced, collecting wood takes longer relative to its usage. Converting wood to charcoal for smelting ores and crafting ammo depletes the resource quickly.The abundance of menus can be overwhelming, making navigation and reward claiming challenging. The game has much to offer but requires better visual organization. UI/UX improvements are essential to enhance the overall experience.SummaryIn conclusion, Once Human offers a kaleidoscope of engaging mechanics, presenting a visually stunning world with thrilling combat and survival elements. With a dedicated development team that values player feedback and respects players’ time, this game has strong potential to evolve into something exceptional. Embark on this immersive journey and uncover the true essence of survival.",kaleidoscop funonc human invit player world fraught fear lifeless object reanim hostil creatur intent human extinct guid otherworldli figur player must battl formid bosstyp enemi edg closer prospect salvat remain uncertain amidst danger bond friendship camaraderi strengthen among inhabit forg new armor weapon enhanc surviv erect wall defens safeguard threat collect deviat game equival pokmon advanc player adept survivalistsgameplayth core gameplay human revolv around survivalcraft primari focu resourc gather aspect wellbalanc avoid excess grindi feel base build epitom balanc creat fulli furnish home requir hour resourc gather planningcraft effici recip complet second bulk craft take minut provid time manag base review charact skill stat variou method expedit increas yield craft item cater limit patiencedevi game pokmonesqu companion found quest end boss level serv variou role craft gather resourc combat unlik contemporari palworld offer numer companion human make rarer enhanc impact player encourag experi find deviat best suit playstylegunplay satisfi encourag player seek cover capit attack opportun reminisc divis less complex combat includ dodgerol frequent use boss fight player skirmish smooth anim add weight action showcas develop team attent detailquest scatter throughout world main quest guid narr side quest reward player deviat experi point resourc variou world quest incit server popul either collabor compet victori reward pvp enthusiast appreci forcedpvp highvalu locat akin divis dark zonearea improvementa new game human bug though none caus crash visual glitch weapon appear hand enemi teleport stuck wall notic issu like address futur updateswhil craft gener balanc collect wood take longer rel usag convert wood charcoal smelt ore craft ammo deplet resourc quicklyth abund menu overwhelm make navig reward claim challeng game much offer requir better visual organ uiux improv essenti enhanc overal experiencesummaryin conclus human offer kaleidoscop engag mechan present visual stun world thrill combat surviv element dedic develop team valu player feedback respect player time game strong potenti evolv someth except embark immers journey uncov true essenc surviv
"I AM A SON OF VULKAN AND BY MY HEAVY FLAMER THE HERETICS AND THE XENOS SHALL BE CLEANSED BY THEIR SIN FO EXISTENCE! FOR THE EMPEROR!Edit: For the love of the Emperor, fix the focus enemy function and all the imputs, because I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up just because the character won't respond to my imputs. I wanna shooty shot the marked enemy, guess what, Titus just stands there and watches.Edit2: The lack of the report button in PVP is mind boggeling. Do you honestly think no one will ever cheat in this game? As Sseth put it: ""Easy Anti-cheat is a very good anti-cheat, because its very easy to turn off"". In almost 30 hours I've encountered at least 10 cheaters and there is no way to report them. If I have to edit this review one more time, I'd have to make it a bad review, and I honestly don't want to, but you give me no choice.Edit3: After finishing the campaign and maxing the wins for the Heavy in PvP, I have to give this game, an overall 5/10. The game looks fantastic, the combat is mid, but satisfying enough to keep you going for more, all the armours and weapons look extraordinary, and the customisation is behind a grind wall and I am rather ok with that since its just cosmetics and no actual gameplay changes (except for multiplayer), but that is about it. This is what I find good in this game.The story is dog water, and its an absolute waste of time, there is no intrigue, there is no stakes, its just under mid-story bits and pieces here and there, the writing is ass, the characters are 1 dimensional (yes, even Titus), the voice acting is better for the Cadians and Imurah than the space marines we play as (even in multiplayer this argument still stands). And what stings the most is the Season Pass. You need to pay 40$ to have the PRIVILEGE to grind your ass off to get the Ultramarine skins. I know they will add more stuff later, but I hope I don't have to buy Season Pass 2 for another 40$ in 2026 just to have the PRIVILEGE of grinding my ass off again. I dont understand this pay-for-more-grind mindset, I understand that the main gameplay will be PvE operations and PvP sop you will always have a lot of currency to use and all that, but in PvE you need to pay the same currency for upgrades that make you more OP. Having to choose between upgrades and customisation should be illegal in this day and age. Not to mention a lose in PvP is like 15 gold and a win is about 25 gold... in 1 hour of PvP you can gain between 90 gold and 150 gold which is enough for 1 chapter unlock, and with dosens of chapters you are asking for hundreds of hours of PvP and PvE just to unlock every customisation possible.I dont mind the default customisation, that is whatever, but the Season Pass is a waste of money, 40$ for 12 ultramarine skins to grind is not worth. Maybe if it was already unlocked then you'd have a maybe, but this is just trash.",son vulkan heavi flamer heret xeno shall cleans sin fo exist emperoredit love emperor fix focu enemi function imput get charact wont respond imput wan na shooti shot mark enemi guess titu stand lack report button pvp mind boggel honestli think one ever cheat game sseth put easi anticheat good anticheat easi turn almost hour ive encount least cheater way report edit review one time id make bad review honestli dont want give finish campaign max win heavi pvp give game overal game look fantast combat mid satisfi enough keep go armour weapon look extraordinari customis behind grind wall rather ok sinc cosmet actual gameplay chang except multiplay find good gameth stori dog water absolut wast time intrigu stake midstori bit piec write ass charact dimension ye even titu voic act better cadian imurah space marin play even multiplay argument still stand sting season pass need pay privileg grind ass get ultramarin skin know add stuff later hope dont buy season pass anoth privileg grind ass dont understand payformoregrind mindset understand main gameplay pve oper pvp sop alway lot currenc use pve need pay currenc upgrad make op choos upgrad customis illeg day age mention lose pvp like gold win gold hour pvp gain gold gold enough chapter unlock dosen chapter ask hundr hour pvp pve unlock everi customis possiblei dont mind default customis whatev season pass wast money ultramarin skin grind worth mayb alreadi unlock youd mayb trash

"2023 Elden Ring was one of the most thrilling and satisfying games I've ever played. The atmosphere completely drew me in, and I had an immense pleasure exploring the world for hours. The game's difficulty might seem intimidating at first, but as I played and learned the enemy attack patterns, the challenge further motivated me. Each victory gave me a tremendous sense of accomplishment.The gameplay was fluid and finely crafted. The controls were responsive, and my movements directly translated to my character. It required time and practice to master the combat system, but the process was incredibly satisfying for me. The inclusion of different weapon and magic options allowed me to diversify my playstyle and provided opportunities to employ different strategies in each battle.In terms of in-game richness, Elden Ring did not disappoint me. There was always a new area to explore, a hidden item to discover, or an intriguing character to encounter around every corner. The bosses' designs, stories, and fighting styles were remarkably impressive. Engaging in side quests and making choices to unravel the stories of characters further connected me to the game world. Additionally, the time loop system allowed me to experience different encounters and events, making each playthrough exciting.Elden Ring's story completely immersed me. The lore and world design were profound and captivating.

Not gonna say as hard as sekiro or souls games but i definitely see the potential because i've fought like 5 bosses in 3 hours and im still in the first area i think, stuck at one of them lol.Lastly my favorite thing, cinematic inclusions to bossfights, really increases the production value in my eyes x)Kind of feels like a god of war and sekiro had a child in a good way, buy it \o/",much expect game realli came suprisecombat realli smooth there mani abil trick even hour gameno need talk graphic expect perform absolut stunningboss fight realli good dodg feint welcom experi gon na say hard sekiro soul game definit see potenti ive fought like boss hour im still first area think stuck one lollastli favorit thing cinemat inclus bossfight realli increas product valu eye xkind feel like god war sekiro child good way buy

"Product received for free Early negative review: seems like if Gear of War if it didn't have a shred of humanity, and looked really good. It's middling in a lot of ways, and the one way it is exceptional is that it is like Zoolander: really really really ridiculously good looking. Graphically demanding, and while it runs fairly well, it has an upscaling menu that bears some dire implications for the future of graphics (AI upscaling presented as balanced option, native resolution presented as ultra-premium quality option). Overheats your PC for fairly basic gameplay. Guns are good, slightly underwhelming, melee is a very lightweight system with a dash of Arkham and not particularly deep. Could be that it gets better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Once again, it feels like Gears of War but with the armor system replacing the cover system. Not in love with the tone, it's very self-serious and dire and slow, and you run into a lot of characters that are just so flat and one dimensional. Not much popcorn appeal there, but it's also hard to take with any gravitas since the game is just about big silly action figures ripping apart lizards. It also lacks the mortality and urgency of Gears characters, since space marines are basically invincible superheroes in their universe walking past expendable nameless IG that they'd be willing to sacrifice without a second's hesitation. Grim, serious (verging on joyless) invincibility fantasy is just an odd wavelength to try and play along with in a basic TPS.

"2023 I love this game. I've been playing this trilogy trilogy when it came out. I have poured hundreds of hours into them. But CA has decided to burn my goodwill and faith. On a game that I would consider my favorite of all time. a 150% price increase on DLC when they are reporting that profits are exceeding costs in their latest annual report (when they justify the price increase by saying things are getting more expensive)They than make it worse with their PR manager advertising to us and not addressing the concerns. Such as the latest DLC that is being charged 150% more giving LESS content than the cheaper packs. Holding bugfixing behind DLC launches, and threatening to drop support of the game if we don't buy DLC. Normally I'd laugh that off. But they canceled Total War 3 Kingdoms because their DLC didn't sell well.I love this game. But with current business practices I cannot in good faith recommend this game.

"2022 Good entry to the souls like games. 8/10 game. Feels like it is Dark souls 3 the sequel. FromSoftware didnt really take too many risks with innovation aside from a free roam map and a new skill system for your weapons this plays exactly like other souls like games. They have learned from some mistakes in their other games but some frustrating issues are still present from other games. The hitboxes in this entry are finally good, you can duck under swings from a sword, jump over attacks its honestly pretty cool but then you still have the same issues that were present in previous games such as enemies being able to hit through walls, AOE projectiles will hit you through floors etc. Performance has also been quite inconsistent. They are still using their really poorly designed (at least imo) summon system. For some bosses if you wish to summon a player but theres not many players currently on that boss (or at least want to be summoned for the boss) then you will see only a small handful of summon signs and by the time you have interacted with them someone else has summoned the player so you missed them. It happens constantly in areas with few summon signs and it is essentially a race to the sign. Summoning your friends has now been made ""easier"" with a password mechanic so only you and your friend can see eachothers summon signs which is fine but if I want me friend to help me with a boss that they have not discovered yet I have to wait for them to get to the area and clear it and get to my location before I can summon. Its just time wasting and it would be so much handier if they could for example just join me through steam to fight the boss and they go back to their own game instead of wasting 30 minutes of both our time. Its an issue iv had with all the souls games I just think the summon mechanic is really bad.Invasions have also been changed in this game to the point where I honestly thought they just got rid of invasions. Instead they have been changed. You can now only be invaded if you are exploring with a coop partner or if you happen to have found and used a specific item that allows players to invade your solo world (why even call it Invasion if you allowing it? Its not really an invasion if you have a choice to be invaded). Most players (or at least among my friend group) do not summon for simple exploration but to fight bosses and seeing as you cannot be invaded mid boss fight we have essentially seen no invasions.The world and dungeons are once again beautifully crafted and if you loved the older games big dungeon design you will feel right at home. The game does suffer however from a few smaller dungeons/caves that are in my opinion poorly designed. You will notice that these smaller dungeons/caves are essentially copy and paste jobs of one another with just a different layout. Some of them are even the exact same layout. There are a few really fun ones that have the most different layouts or require you to do some thinking on how to progress but for the most part the dungeons are quick, easy, and very similar to one another.Enemy and boss designs are once again amazing looking however I still do not understand why they put Margit as one of the first bosses as he is far harder than even some late game bosses.The Horse is fine. It is mostly used for traversal. Mounted combat on horseback is very basic and aside from using the horse to help with fighting the games many Dragons (mostly using it to dodge firebreath attacks when the Dragon flies) it is pretty boring to fight whilst mounted.Overall it is probably one of the best of FromSoftwares games. Is it a masterpiece? No. The devs have improved on nearly every aspect of the series but have taken few risks in innovation and actually doing anything new. I think FromSoftware can do better as this just feels like a souls game but with an open world.",good entri soul like game game feel like dark soul sequel fromsoftwar didnt realli take mani risk innov asid free roam map new skill system weapon play exactli like soul like game learn mistak game frustrat issu still present game hitbox entri final good duck swing sword jump attack honestli pretti cool still issu present previou game enemi abl hit wall aoe projectil hit floor etc perform also quit inconsist still use realli poorli design least imo summon system boss wish summon player there mani player current boss least want summon boss see small hand summon sign time interact someon els summon player miss happen constantli area summon sign essenti race sign summon friend made easier password mechan friend see eachoth summon sign fine want friend help boss discov yet wait get area clear get locat summon time wast would much handier could exampl join steam fight boss go back game instead wast minut time issu iv soul game think summon mechan realli badinvas also chang game point honestli thought got rid invas instead chang invad explor coop partner happen found use specif item allow player invad solo world even call invas allow realli invas choic invad player least among friend group summon simpl explor fight boss see invad mid boss fight essenti seen invasionsth world dungeon beauti craft love older game big dungeon design feel right home game suffer howev smaller dungeonscav opinion poorli design notic smaller dungeonscav essenti copi past job one anoth differ layout even exact layout realli fun one differ layout requir think progress part dungeon quick easi similar one anotherenemi boss design amaz look howev still understand put margit one first boss far harder even late game bossesth hors fine mostli use travers mount combat horseback basic asid use hors help fight game mani dragon mostli use dodg firebreath attack dragon fli pretti bore fight whilst mountedoveral probabl one best fromsoftwar game masterpiec dev improv nearli everi aspect seri taken risk innov actual anyth new think fromsoftwar better feel like soul game open world

"Nobody will read my review, so I'll just say ♥♥♥♥ anyone who starts their comment like that (except me). This game deserves way better than cheap, lazy spam. I’ve 100% completed Elden Ring on PS5, got the platinum trophy which was an absolute blast, and now I’m diving into it on PC. FromSoftware, you’ve seriously outdone yourselves. Elden Ring is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's hard to imagine how you'll ever top this.From the moment I stepped into this vast, mysterious world, I was hooked. The blend of deep lore, challenging combat, and stunning landscapes is just incredible. The gameplay is smoth and perfectly balanced, making every fight feel like a rewarding test of skill.Exploring the world of Elden Ring is pure joy. It's packed with secrets, hidden paths, and lore that keeps you wanting more. The environmental storyteling is so rich that every corner of the map feels worth investigating. Each region has its own uniqie look and feel, so exploration never gets boring.Now, let’s talk about the only thing that annoys me: the catacombs or dungeons. This has been a problem since Bloodborne (my favorite game of all time). Even though Elden Ring does it better than Bloodborne, every dungeon still feels a bit like an AI-generated copy-paste job. But hey, they’re still fun.The character builds you can create in Elden Ring are better than in any Souls game before it. Whether you’re into melee combat, magic, or a mix of both, the depth here is just amazing.In short, Elden Ring isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. FromSoftware has set a new standard for the genre and maybe created a new genre, and I can’t wait to see what they do with the DLC. If you haven’t played it yet, do yourself a favor and dive in. You won’t regret it.",nobodi read review ill say anyon start comment like except game deserv way better cheap lazi spam ive complet elden ring got platinum trophi absolut blast im dive pc fromsoftwar youv serious outdon elden ring noth short phenomen hard imagin youll ever top thisfrom moment step vast mysteri world hook blend deep lore challeng combat stun landscap incred gameplay smoth perfectli balanc make everi fight feel like reward test skillexplor world elden ring pure joy pack secret hidden path lore keep want environment storytel rich everi corner map feel worth investig region uniqi look feel explor never get boringnow let talk thing annoy catacomb dungeon problem sinc bloodborn favorit game time even though elden ring better bloodborn everi dungeon still feel bit like aigener copypast job hey theyr still funth charact build creat elden ring better soul game whether your mele combat magic mix depth amazingin short elden ring isnt game experi fromsoftwar set new standard genr mayb creat new genr cant wait see dlc havent play yet favor dive wont regret
"Product received for free I recently had the pleasure of playing Black Myth Wukong, and I must say that it is truly a masterpiece. The game is a return to form for the action-adventure genre, with its fast-paced combat, intricate puzzles, and beautiful open world. I am grateful to the developers, Game Science, for bringing us such a high-quality game.One of the things that sets Black Myth Wukong apart from other games is its commitment to its vision. The game does not bend to the ""woke agenda"" as many other recent titles have in past years. Instead, it stays true to its roots and delivers an experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. The performance of Black Myth Wukong is also top-notch. Even on an older system, the game runs smoothly and looks stunning. I was able to run the game on max settings with no issues, which is a testament to the optimization work done by the developers.I will easily put 1000+ hours into this game. The world of Black Myth Wukong is so rich and detailed that I find myself lost in it for several hours at a time. The combat is also incredibly satisfying, with a wide range of weapons and abilities to choose from.In conclusion, Black Myth Wukong is a must-play for any fan of action-adventure games. It is a return to form for the genre, and a shining example of what games can be when developers are allowed to focus on creating a great experience, rather than pandering to a political agenda.

"2022 Elden Ring is a phenomenal game but it's hard to look over the hurdles I had to overcome in order to fully enjoy this game.Gameplay: The initial 20 hours of this game were tolerable at best. The first area is too dense for it's own good, filled with the most amount of copy and paste catacombs/caves, containing useless loot 90% of the time. I felt as if my thorough exploration wasn't appropriately rewarded. While this problem persisted throughout my 80 hour play through, it became far less egregious as the filler content became far and few between with an increase in more intricate world and level design.The game truly opens up after you conquer the first legacy dungeon. Suddenly, most of the gear actually becomes useful, and it was refreshing to finally swap weapons 20 hours into the game. This gameplay loop of exploring, killing bosses and looting never got tiresome, because the game gives plenty of opportunities for experimentation and trying new things. Despite the abundance of reused enemies, it was still fun to tackle them with a different strategy.Story: Like every other souls game, the devs didn't bother to explicitly tell me what was going on so I responded by not bothering to pay any attention to the story. The cutscenes and voice acting were cool though.Difficulty: Enemies are extremely aggressive and fast, making these some of the most brutal battles in the series. However, the late games bosses are the definition of artificial difficulty.Overall 9/10",elden ring phenomen game hard look hurdl overcom order fulli enjoy gamegameplay initi hour game toler best first area dens good fill amount copi past catacombscav contain useless loot time felt thorough explor wasnt appropri reward problem persist throughout hour play becam far less egregi filler content becam far increas intric world level designth game truli open conquer first legaci dungeon suddenli gear actual becom use refresh final swap weapon hour game gameplay loop explor kill boss loot never got tiresom game give plenti opportun experiment tri new thing despit abund reus enemi still fun tackl differ strategystori like everi soul game dev didnt bother explicitli tell go respond bother pay attent stori cutscen voic act cool thoughdifficulti enemi extrem aggress fast make brutal battl seri howev late game boss definit artifici difficultyoveral

"This game feels like its from a bygone age, one where Microsoft and Xbox were putting up a fight (and maybe even winning) against Sony in the Console Wars. Its great.An entertaining linear story mode at around 5-6 hours (on Normal mode), though for maximum enjoyment you should have played or at least seen a recap of Space Marine 1. (And/or understanding Warhammer 40K lore)A 3 man Co-op ""Operations"" mode that sees you play as your own different Marines that you can customize head to toe (from 6 different classes) and go on missions with other aspiring recruits/players trying to level up and score better gear.Though at the moment there are only 6 missions to complete. They mostly feel good to play through, and multiple runs are needed to upgrade and level up your Space Marine.(This is also the live-service, seasonal part of the game so expect content updates unless something completely unexpected happens).There is also a very fun but very dry no nonsense PVP akin to old COD lobbies but without the vulgarities, racism, and probably no no-scopes (yet). Hope the devs update this ""Eternal War"" mode as well cause there is some good building blocks to work with.Combat is very fun, consisting of dodges and parries to outmaneuver and counterattack the enemy respectively. Not too much to learn other than the timings of parries/dodges and melee combos of each weapon but the chaotic horde-style gameplay will still sometimes give you problems even if you have mastered the intricate art of murdering other Alien lifeforms.8.5/10 or 9/10 if you are already a fan of 40K.",game feel like bygon age one microsoft xbox put fight mayb even win soni consol war greatan entertain linear stori mode around hour normal mode though maximum enjoy play least seen recap space marin andor understand warhamm lorea man coop oper mode see play differ marin custom head toe differ class go mission aspir recruitsplay tri level score better gearthough moment mission complet mostli feel good play multipl run need upgrad level space marinethi also liveservic season part game expect content updat unless someth complet unexpect happensther also fun dri nonsens pvp akin old cod lobbi without vulgar racism probabl noscop yet hope dev updat etern war mode well caus good build block work withcombat fun consist dodg parri outmaneuv counterattack enemi respect much learn time parriesdodg mele combo weapon chaotic hordestyl gameplay still sometim give problem even master intric art murder alien alreadi fan
"Tl;dr, a game designed to take your money hidden by beautiful graphics.The Good: Once Human has very pretty graphics and an oustanding atmosphere I've been missing in a lot of games. The character creator with it's presets allow you lots of freedom - even with your body. Something I've missed in most games where it was either ""slim or slightly thicker"". The story is interesting and was almost compelling for me to continue. The cinematics and music are pretty to look at and listen to as well.The Bad: In the few hours I've played, I had many moments of ""oh that's like x/y game"". Usually a compliment, but not in this case - and not in an ""they took inspiration from x/y game and implemented it"" way but an ""let's change 2 things and straight copy/paste it"". As I said, the atmosphere is beautiful - but the otherworld (don't call me out on not knowing the names - it's a bit confusing tbf) could be a copy/paste of Control. So far I've felt awful Deja Vu for Prey, Death Stranding, NieR and Control, with heavy emphasis on Control and Death Stranding. Again, not in a good way.I've played a handful of survival games and this one has by far the worst HUD, menu and crafting system - because the game is designed to make money off of microtransactions (which shouldn't be called ""micro"" considering you have to spent 30€ for a skin). Makes sense, otherwise it wouldn't be free. But then, in my opinion, a survival openworld is the wrong genre to make money off of it. First look into the store I was greeted with a ton of timed events and things happening - many things you have to unlock by money first (should be noted that there's a season pass, which should be a crime in itself for a survival open world).Unimportant HUD things are too large and in the way while important HUD symbols like your thirst and hunger are at an odd place and too small. The crafting menu reminds me of Fortnite tbh. Also there's a crafting queue and timer on how long the thing you wanna craft is going to take. Even though a friend and I chose the same server and same world, we still landed in different ones. No biggie, the teleportation towers brought us together fast. The mc/player feels very... bad, so to say. We have absolutely no facial expressions and we move in a very clunky way (mouse sensitivity on highest setting and somehow it's STILL too slow - have to drag my mouse across the whole mousepad to do a 180). We have few dialogue options for the tutorial intro and I see what they've tried to do with choosing different questions the mc can ask and instead of giving the mc a voice, they let us do weird motions AS IF we were speaking - just that we are not and our face doesn't move an inch. They should have either opted for full voicing like in Mass Effect or none at all and go straight to the dialogue like in Baldur's Gate and similar games where you are presented with dialogue options.Conclusion:The interest in the story and the artstyle was almost enough to convince me to force myself through it. Others may find it entertaining to play - and I really do hope there are some people out there, because the game IS beautiful in what it's trying to be; but so many unimportant or even the wrong things were given too much attention.

"2022 I only played through about half the campaigns but here's a small list of what I noticed1.) I can run units through other units with almost no resistance, this means there's effectively there is no front line.2.) Ogres can't be knocked over, it's weird watching one tank a cannon shot in the face and immediately shoot back.Cathy have a unique stance. This drastically reduces unit performance so a major mechanic of the faction makes them worse if you decide to use it.3.) ranged units have targeting issues. They will, seemingly without reason, be unable to fire at targets that are within plain view of them4.) ranged units will sometimes decide to melee charge another unit instead when you order them to shoot them5.) large drops in performance once the portals open up on the campaign map.6.) certain quest battles will crash the game when you try them for the first time7.) Calvary charges usually annihilate unit formation with no real logic to it. The heavily armored cav charges will do less than they did in warhammer 2 to regular empire swordsman but a charge from light cav will send chaos knights units flying through the air for several seconds and completely scatter the formation? Something is clearly wrong with the way mass is being calculated.8.)spells are out of balance. I noticed spells that were ok from previous titles are wiping out units or destroying the formation now. (looking at you pendulum)9.) the cutscenes are all copy and paste. it's jarring watching the same cut scene for different faction leaders. 10.) the chaos invasion makes so that occasionally ill be fighting 6 or 7 armies at a single town in one turn and then I'll have to fight 3 or 4 more the next turn with the battered army. it's incredibly tedious.11.) dealing with corruption is a chore, there's 7 or 8 different types, it's ridiculous Wait to see if the modding community is able to fix these issues. if not then don't pay more than dlc price for the game because that's what it feels like.

"2023 Theres a lot more they have added over the years to your campaign map features, building outposts in other factions settlements, war coordination is better and has more options, quests issued by other factions as well as setting quests for other factions, there are many quests centered around artifacts/gear and map elements as well. Interesting events occur during the campaign and overall I'd say that the turn based campaign portion of total war has never been better. Each faction being so different in warhammer has allowed for interesting faction-unique systems to be implemented that keep each playthrough fresh. The mechanics behind each faction will drive you to play very differently than you played the last and it has really sucked me back in to total war for the first time in years. The ""RPG"" elements are deeper than ever, which I understand was never the draw of total war, but truthfully, in this fantasy setting I have found that it adds a great layer of gameplay I really enjoy. Sending an army stack off to go on an epic quest for it's leading lord is truthfully fun af and it feels like every lord, even the randomly generated ones, can develop a whole story of their own. Meanwhile you are still playing total war.The engine is the best this time around it has ever been. It runs so smooth I can scarcely believe it. I am using the same cpu I played attila on and the difference is night and day. I have had no AI issues, the unit mass seems perfect, the animations are the best they have been and the game just plays extremely well, even on keep walls. It is really exciting to play through imo and if you have stepped away from total war for a time, coming back will be a huge breathe of fresh air. It is so good, my fiance who has never played this kind of game, took to it immediately. It is still the warhammer versions of total war, so expect extremely powerful lords with rpg features, but this game proves the next historical title will be a home-run because of it's engine and AI improvements alone. A big leap forward for the total war franchise.CA sucks for the way they monetize their games though. I wish steam ratings were star based so I could take a star off for that... but.. I have to admit. They have something locked down that is just insanely unique and impressive and they deserve to be the kings of this genre, it's just so frustrating to stumble through their lists of dlc and insane prices. They STILL sell blood in their games. One thing I will give them is they made it so if you own blood for the blood god in any of the warhammer games it unlocks it for warhammer 3, which is great, but it's not an accolade I feel right giving because it should not be there in the first place.Overall, epic fantasy total war game from a greedy publisher.",there lot ad year campaign map featur build outpost faction settlement war coordin better option quest issu faction well set quest faction mani quest center around artifactsgear map element well interest event occur campaign overal id say turn base campaign portion total war never better faction differ warhamm allow interest factionuniqu system implement keep playthrough fresh mechan behind faction drive play differ play last realli suck back total war first time year rpg element deeper ever understand never draw total war truth fantasi set found add great layer gameplay realli enjoy send armi stack go epic quest lead lord truth fun af feel like everi lord even randomli gener one develop whole stori meanwhil still play total warth engin best time around ever run smooth scarc believ use cpu play attila differ night day ai issu unit mass seem perfect anim best game play extrem well even keep wall realli excit play imo step away total war time come back huge breath fresh air good fianc never play kind game took immedi still warhamm version total war expect extrem power lord rpg featur game prove next histor titl homerun engin ai improv alon big leap forward total war franchiseca suck way monet game though wish steam rate star base could take star admit someth lock insan uniqu impress deserv king genr frustrat stumbl list dlc insan price still sell blood game one thing give made blood blood god warhamm game unlock warhamm great accolad feel right give first placeoveral epic fantasi total war game greedi publish

"2023 I really want to like this game as I liked Total War Warhammer 2, but in the current state it is simply not enjoyable. There are plenty of things that bother me like e.g. the excessive bloom on some textures, the way-to-strong depth of field and blur, the stutter and performance issues on some battlemaps and after end turns, and lackluster sieges (the list goes on and on). My main gripes are with the completely annoying, overly player-focussed, incompetent, and predictable AI and the enormous amount of bugs (among the most egregious are not-spawing-Ariel and the absence of Kroxigors for Nakai).Where Warhammer 2 was fun and polished, TWW3 is simply messy and non-functional. It breaks my heart to see the game that should be TWW2, but bigger and better, in such a miserable state.I suspect (hope) the devs are trying their best but probably as it is often the case upper management puts profits from new content over a functioning product. This is how we get a overprized 25$ DLC when the base game is in such an atrocious state.I didn't buy the Chaos Dwarfs and will continue to not buy anything from CA until they deliver an actually functioning product (which I paid for).

"2022 After 100 hours i can say that its one of my favourite games ever and it might just be my favourite Fromsoft title. For me, they nailed every aspect of what i love about the Souls titles and put it into an expansive and aesthetically gorgeous world. Being honest i cannot praise the visual and area design enough, it feels like Ds1 but larger and more grand. I personally hail Ds1's design as ""perfect"" as can be so take what i said as you will. As usual the music is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fantastic too. So so many new types of spells and incantations which open up many more interesting types of builds than we've had before. Ive personally planned a multitude of themed characters to play through both in PvP and PvE. The lore of Elden Ring is also superb and i think also the most accessible lore so far in a Fromsoft title. Also General Radahn is an absolute chad. My only criticisms of Elden Ring would be the copy pasted bosses as general enemies in late areas of the game or having 2x the boss for a boss fight. I personally feel like they're a crutch and also diminish earlier emotions of victory from beating a boss and 2x bosses in an area is, IMO, ""lazy"" Elden Ring is a BIG game, perhaps one of the largest ive ever played but to me everything about Elden Ring is big and grand and just absolutely deserves your attention.

"2022 10/10I can understand people are not satisfied with stuttering and frame drops here and there. However, while I have issues like stuttering too, they are not game-breaking for me and to be honest it is so easy to look pass these minor flaws.The combat, the story, and environment, the level design, the music, all perfect. Just like what we would expect from From Software.They do seem to like to put big boss monsters in tight limited dungeon space though. And it seems they like copy and pasting bosses here and there too (You will see similar boss which are just usually bigger version of their dungeon counterpart).While I personally still enjoy Sekiro's combat system more, the combat system in Elden Ring is 34572093x better than that of Dark Souls 3, and that alone would make me want to keep playing this game.TL;DR: Minor performance issue, almost perfect everything else.",understand peopl satisfi stutter frame drop howev issu like stutter gamebreak honest easi look pass minor flawsth combat stori environ level design music perfect like would expect softwarethey seem like put big boss monster tight limit dungeon space though seem like copi past boss see similar boss usual bigger version dungeon counterpartwhil person still enjoy sekiro combat system combat system elden ring better dark soul alon would make want keep play gametldr minor perform issu almost perfect everyth els

If they made it so that your other lords could actually use the rifts to traverse the map, even if they can't get into the chaos god areas, it would be functional as you'd be able to delay or even prevent other faction leaders from entering the rifts and letting you catch up.Just wait until Immortal Empires, at least then there will be a game mode that's enjoyable.",campaign still hilari aw month releas your behind first rift never abl win campaign convent without spend upward anoth turn send nonfact leader armi across map remov faction game thu eventu free faction leader final get soul need made lord could actual use rift travers map even cant get chao god area would function youd abl delay even prevent faction leader enter rift let catch upjust wait immort empir least game mode that enjoy

"2022 If you like dark souls or any souls like game, play this. If you like breath of the wild or any open world game, play this.Idk, just play this. Give it a chance if you aren't used to this type of gamed.FromSoftware never fails to deliver with the quality of their games. The amount of though that goes into creating the background stories and the environments of this game is unrivalled. This is one of the finest open world games to ever be made. You may be familiar with the classic open world games that studios like ubisoft is making now, go here do this. go there do that. This game is not like that. Exploring is one of the best things about this game and it truly feels rewarding. This game is full of content not just filler. There are so many unique situations that are wonderful. From enemies to friendly npcs and their stories and to weapons there is a huge variety of content. Heck I'm 95 hours in and I havn't finished the game yet but none of it has felt like a chore. I've enjoyed all of it and it 's definitely my favourite game of all time.There are a lot of people getting stuck on this game either saying it's too hard or that it should have a quest log. Some people are seeing the first hard enemy they find and giving up because they can't beat it. You don't have to! It's an important lesson that you can leave that challenge for later and just explore the world. Not having a quest counter makes this game much better. As people have suggested if you really want to you can get a pen and paper to help you remember characters. Don't complain that this is dumb because you aren't in school anymore. I'm sure you can manage. It makes the game so much more natural. You aren't meant to complete quests perfectly and it Isn't really possible to. If you miss a character or a part of a quest it may change other npcs stories in doing so. This makes them so organic and unique to you. You have to puzzle together their dialogue and this world in your own way. If you find something too challenging there is always something else you can try in this game. A different sword, a ranged weapon, magic, a summon, bring a friend along!TLDR: This is one hell of a game with rich and vibrant environments with deep lore. With a lot of it written by George R R Martin adding to even more of what we've come to love from Miyazaki. At it's core this game is an epic fantasy open world with great solid combat and it goes beyond that and is so much more as it's elements have been refined over years of FromSoftware experience.",like dark soul soul like game play like breath wild open world game play thisidk play give chanc arent use type gamedfromsoftwar never fail deliv qualiti game amount though goe creat background stori environ game unrival one finest open world game ever made may familiar classic open world game studio like ubisoft make go go game like explor one best thing game truli feel reward game full content filler mani uniqu situat wonder enemi friendli npc stori weapon huge varieti content heck im hour havnt finish game yet none felt like chore ive enjoy definit favourit game timether lot peopl get stuck game either say hard quest log peopl see first hard enemi find give cant beat dont import lesson leav challeng later explor world quest counter make game much better peopl suggest realli want get pen paper help rememb charact dont complain dumb arent school anymor im sure manag make game much natur arent meant complet quest perfectli isnt realli possibl miss charact part quest may chang npc stori make organ uniqu puzzl togeth dialogu world way find someth challeng alway someth els tri game differ sword rang weapon magic summon bring friend alongtldr one hell game rich vibrant environ deep lore lot written georg r r martin ad even weve come love miyazaki core game epic fantasi open world great solid combat goe beyond much element refin year fromsoftwar experi

"2022 Let me preface my recommendation with this: This game in its current state is recommended for enfranchised players of the Warhammer series. At this time I wouldn’t recommend it for newer players or even historical players who have jot played the previous two games. I’ll also preface that at this point I have just completed the tutorial campaign and I am 20 turns into a Demon Prince campaign, so I won’t talk about anything beyond that scope.My specs:Geforce RTX 3070Ryzen 5 5600x 3.4ghz8GB DDR4 RAMI play at 1440p on a curved monitor.The good: The game contains a number of important quality of life improvements from the last game. Aside from the well discussed battle and campaign features that have solved problems we both knew we had and some which we didn’t know we had until they fixed them, CA have clearly learned the importance of having each faction be mechanically unique. Further, the tutorial campaign is exceptionally good, both as a narrative and an onboarding experience.I’ve seen a lot of people criticising graphics. For me, graphically, the game is an improvement from Warhammer particularly in unit detail and effects. I made a point to have a close look at WoC units to compare. I understand that some people criticise the change in visual style on the campaign map, with some finding it to be an overly simplified look. This is not a technical issue therefore, it is an artistic question. I personally prefer this style - perhaps it is playing on a higher resolution screen, but I am finding the campaign world a lot more immersive - in the previous games the campaign map was very homogenous per each region - whereas within one specific region in this game local areas feel a lot more diverse.The bad:For all the positive qol changes, sadly there are some things which have actually led to a quality of life decrease. Of particular note are the unit placement highlights and orders, which on the white snow background seem to be almost invisible. I find this extremely surprising that this has not been addressed before release. Unit order legibility is honestly one of the most important parts of managing battles so I sincerely hope they do something to make them stand out against the snow, which is a very common sight in this game.There are issues currently with running the game at 1440p and if you try to run it windowed you will find the top of the screen cut off - there is no screen safe space adjustment option so your only choice is to run full screen. I hope these issues will be addressed post haste.Conclusion:As stated in my preface, this review is based on a small time playing. Overall the issues I have faced have not been massively impactful and I am enjoying the game immensely. Still I hope these issues are addressed as soon as possible.",let prefac recommend game current state recommend enfranchis player warhamm seri time wouldnt recommend newer player even histor player jot play previou two game ill also prefac point complet tutori campaign turn demon princ campaign wont talk anyth beyond scopemi specsgeforc rtx rami play curv monitorth good game contain number import qualiti life improv last game asid well discuss battl campaign featur solv problem knew didnt know fix ca clearli learn import faction mechan uniqu tutori campaign except good narr onboard experienc seen lot peopl criticis graphic graphic game improv warhamm particularli unit detail effect made point close look woc unit compar understand peopl criticis chang visual style campaign map find overli simplifi look technic issu therefor artist question person prefer style perhap play higher resolut screen find campaign world lot immers previou game campaign map homogen per region wherea within one specif region game local area feel lot diverseth badfor posit qol chang sadli thing actual led qualiti life decreas particular note unit placement highlight order white snow background seem almost invis find extrem surpris address releas unit order legibl honestli one import part manag battl sincer hope someth make stand snow common sight gamether issu current run game tri run window find top screen cut screen safe space adjust option choic run full screen hope issu address post hasteconclusiona state prefac review base small time play overal issu face massiv impact enjoy game immens still hope issu address soon possibl

"评分：9.5/10首先声明，我手比较笨，接触类似的游戏也比较少，所以现在刚刚进入第二章。仅就目前的体验给予评价。优点：1、游戏性，作为传统动作RPG，游戏基本满足了我对类似游戏的期望——通过战斗积累经验以及相关资源，并以此提高自身能力从而挑战更高难度。技能看起来很多，或许会有不平衡的地方，但作为一款单机游戏，其影响不会太大。2、画面，非常优秀，没开光追和DLSS也能感受到整体画面的瑰丽，特别是以写实风格展现出的逼真的中国山水。开篇天庭的战斗场面里云雾缭绕的氛围也是十分出色。3、音乐，超出预期，无论是几次预告中所展现的音乐，还是第二章开篇之前没听过的秦腔，都展现了深厚的音乐创作能力——无论填词还是谱曲都满足了我对游戏内容的想象。可以说对一款不以音乐为卖点的游戏，实在是超出了我的预期。缺点：1、闪避判定似乎过于严苛了，又或者在进攻的过程中无法中断进攻进行闪避，这导致我感受到的游戏难度超出预期。总结：《黑神话：悟空》在游戏性没有特别出彩的情况下，实则在其他方面展现出了惊人的能力，着实将这款游戏变成了一部可以并且需要全方位欣赏的作品，整体品质令人惊叹。——————————————————————————Rating: 9.5/10First, I should clarify that I'm not very skilled with my hands, and I haven't played many games of this genre, so I've only just reached the second chapter. This review is based on my current experience.Pros:1. Gameplay: As a traditional action RPG, the game basically meets my expectations for this type of game—gaining experience and resources through combat to improve abilities and face more challenging difficulties. The skills seem plentiful, and while there may be some balance issues, since this is a single-player game, it shouldn't have too much of an impact.2. Graphics: Very impressive. Even without ray tracing and DLSS, the overall visual beauty is stunning, especially the realistic depiction of Chinese landscapes. The atmosphere in the opening battle in the Heavenly Court, with its swirling mists, is also exceptionally well done.3. Music: Exceeded my expectations. Whether it's the music showcased in the trailers or the Qin opera in the opening of the second chapter that I hadn't heard before, the music demonstrates strong compositional skills—both the lyrics and the score align with my imagination of the game's content. For a game that doesn't primarily focus on music, it truly surpassed my expectations.Cons:Dodge Mechanism: The dodge timing seems overly strict, or perhaps it's the inability to interrupt an attack to dodge that makes the game feel more difficult than expected.Summary:While <<Black Myth: Wukong>> doesn't particularly stand out in gameplay, it excels in other areas, turning the game into a piece of art that can and should be appreciated from all angles. The overall quality is truly remarkable.",clarifi im skill hand havent play mani game genr ive reach second chapter review base current gameplay tradit action rpg game basic meet expect type gamegain experi resourc combat improv abil face challeng difficulti skill seem plenti may balanc issu sinc singleplay game shouldnt much graphic impress even without ray trace dlss overal visual beauti stun especi realist depict chines landscap atmospher open battl heavenli court swirl mist also except well music exceed expect whether music showcas trailer qin opera open second chapter hadnt heard music demonstr strong composit skillsboth lyric score align imagin game content game doesnt primarili focu music truli surpass expectationsconsdodg mechan dodg time seem overli strict perhap inabl interrupt attack dodg make game feel difficult expectedsummarywhil doesnt particularli stand gameplay excel area turn game piec art appreci angl overal qualiti truli remark

"i wish steam had an in-between option for reviews, because while the gameplay is fun, i don't think it's worth the price with the current level of content. there's a fairly short (6 mission) campaign, 6 operations missions which play out alongside the main campaign, and a barebones PVP mode which is okay. The combat is good but can be a bit janky, especially the melee combat. the control scheme isn't great for mouse & keyboard and was obviously designed with console controllers in mind. I had a few weird bugs, including character/weapon/enemy models becoming invisible & connection issues trying to play operations with a friend, but i appreciate it's still very early days and these will likely be fixed. i'll almost definitely come back to this game in future if/when they add more content, but currently it's far too expensive for what you get.",wish steam inbetween option review gameplay fun dont think worth price current level content there fairli short mission campaign oper mission play alongsid main campaign barebon pvp mode okay combat good bit janki especi mele combat control scheme isnt great mous keyboard obvious design consol control mind weird bug includ characterweaponenemi model becom invis connect issu tri play oper friend appreci still earli day like fix ill almost definit come back game futur ifwhen add content current far expens get

An absolute masterpiece. My testosterone levels tripled while playing this. This is my favorite campaign experience since Red Dead 2.

"I was on the fence about whether to recommend this game or not before I realized that if I need to think about it, then I can’t recommend it. Still, Black Myth: Wukong is about as close to getting a recommendation as a game that I don’t recommend can be, if that’s worth anything. If you can snag this on sale for $30 or $40, it’s worth that price. It’s also important to support games like this and Stellar Blade that show that countries not known for producing solid single-player games can do just that. But there is a limit to what that leeway will allow. Wukong is so close to being such a solid game. Sadly, as I continued playing, I was having less and less fun with it. Maybe my expectations were too high for a developer’s first “real” video game. Maybe I should have expected some of the jank and some of the issues in the game. Then again, for a $60 game that presents itself as being on the same level as other AAA titles, maybe it isn’t completely unfair that my expectations were as high as they were for Wukong. The game starts strong with Wukong talking insane amounts of trash to a literally massive Celestial Court. I was all for that. I was ready to be on board with this character. I was ready for a story where he could grow from this brash character across a long journey. Wukong in the intro was so enjoyable that it was a punch in the mouth when we got stuck with a mute monkey that has no personality, character, or charm. Looking back on it, I think the Destined One was probably meant to be a character you project yourself onto. That’s all fine and good, but sadly, I wasn’t a monkey swinging around a staff the last time I checked, so that fell a little flat. That start put me in a disappointed mindset. I can’t help but feel like it would have been better to include that glorified cutscene toward the end of the game instead of leaving the player with a jarring character shift right at the start of the story. In fact, a lot of the other characters are fun to watch, which makes the Destined One’s complete lack of character even more annoying to deal with as the story progresses. I get that writing a character to be the focal point of a long story can be hard, but come on, this was based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature in the world. Something more than a mute monkey could have been done here. In fact, despite being based on one of the most iconic pieces of Chinese literature ever, the story isn’t up to much at all. I will concede that this might be because I’m entirely unfamiliar with Journey to the West, but I think I can be forgiven for expecting a standalone game to tell a story. The second, third, or fourth game in a series? Sure, it’s on me for not knowing what’s going on. I’m not putting not having a firm grip on the narrative on me in this instance, not when the story dumps come in the form of “music videos” before dropping me in the middle of a brand-new area and biome. Mighty nice-looking biomes, mind you. Granted, they’re the kind of nice-looking that’s better for pretty screenshots instead of practical and intuitive level design. After Chapter 1, the areas are just too big. I felt like I was spending most of my time running around, trying to hunt for secrets since I wanted to get as much out of the game as possible, and that became annoying. Granted, I appreciate a developer who puts huge areas and missable secrets in games that are both cool and help with the future critical path stuff. It makes it worth the player’s time and effort to engage with side content, and in the world of bloated games like Assassin’s Creed and Star Wars Outlaws, having side content that’s worth engaging with is a huge plus. Still, the level design became almost unbearable in Chapter 6 when I was trying to spot small, interesting-looking areas while flying around on a cloud that looked so bad it belonged in an N64 game. I know you made very pretty environments. They are very pretty indeed. Please, when you make the inevitable sequel to this game, trim the fat down, make the areas smaller, add better indicators for what’s a pile of rubble that’s worth climbing on and what isn’t, and let people focus on the best part of your game: the combat. The combat, while the best part of the game—particularly against the visually impressive bosses—still has its own set of baggage. There’s a robust set of skill trees, and while there aren’t really “builds” in Wukong, there are plenty of options to shake up your play style. There are probably too many skill tree options, but unlike Path of Exile, looking at Wukong’s skill trees doesn’t make me want to puke. Low bar to clear but clear it Wukong did. The biggest issue with the combat is that it just doesn’t work half the time. I have no idea how they worked on this game for so long, hanging their hat on the combat, and somehow aerial heavy attacks just don’t connect. It was insane how many times I would walk up to a stationary enemy, jump in the air, and use my heavy attack, just for my hit to not connect. This game spent 6 years in development. I should not have issues hitting an aerial heavy attack because the game decided to take a nap on the job. Enemy hitboxes and hurtboxes in general aren’t very good. Too many attacks would miss because an enemy bigger than my apartment wiggled an inch to the left. Of course, that rule doesn’t apply to you. In the interest of fairness, the Destined One decided to expand his hurtbox to twice his normal size on either side of him. The only exception to this is when you’re in your Rock Solid—the game’s parry—form. Then enemy attacks will often conveniently miss you until you’re out of your Rock Solid form. Rock Solid is one of the first spells that just won't work half the time. There’s a bug where you can use your Immobilize spell on a boss, but it won’t work, and the boss will hit you anyway and out your spell on cooldown. I’m giving the developers the benefit of the doubt by saying this is a bug, because if it’s intentional game design to have the immobilize spell not immobilize when used, then it’s inexcusable. Even when the spells do work, there’s a chunk of bosses that just don’t let you use them. You’ll use Immobilize, and what is essentially plot armor kicks in, and they say you don’t get to use that spell. Nope, it doesn’t matter how many points you invested into that spell. You don’t get to use it on the boss because the game says you can’t. On top of that, some of the boss fights are horrendously designed and were the tipping points into making me realize the game just wasn’t as fun as it had been. Despite the game itself getting easier as it went on thanks to the upgrades, the devs made sure to study up on Manus, Father of the Abyss, to make sure they got their spastic flailing down just right. At least the worst single attack most bosses have in their arsenals is the lost mystical art of a random 20 FPS drop.Yellow Loong and Erlang are two boss fights that are exceptionally bad, making sure they stocked up on their Elden Ring 18-hit, flailing combos along with plenty of poise (a trait shared with normal enemies, for some reason) to ensure they got to be as annoying as possible. When they decide you’ve had too much fun and got to play the game too much, they make sure to take to the air for a few years, letting you contemplate your sins of winning too hard. You know what? Perhaps that’s in line with the game’s themes. Disappointingly, Wukong is a game of numerous small irritations that surround the core of something that could be so much better. In a game that can take around 40 hours to complete when doing as much content as possible, numerous small irritations start to mount and pile on to the point that the game is best purchased on sale, or at the very least, when some of those issues get ironed out.",fenc whether recommend game realiz need think cant recommend still black myth wukong close get recommend game dont recommend that worth anyth snag sale worth price also import support game like stellar blade show countri known produc solid singleplay game limit leeway allow wukong close solid game sadli continu play less less fun mayb expect high develop first real video game mayb expect jank issu game game present level aaa titl mayb isnt complet unfair expect high wukong game start strong wukong talk insan amount trash liter massiv celesti court readi board charact readi stori could grow brash charact across long journey wukong intro enjoy punch mouth got stuck mute monkey person charact charm look back think destin one probabl meant charact project onto that fine good sadli wasnt monkey swing around staff last time check fell littl flat start put disappoint mindset cant help feel like would better includ glorifi cutscen toward end game instead leav player jar charact shift right start stori fact lot charact fun watch make destin one complet lack charact even annoy deal stori progress get write charact focal point long stori hard come base one icon piec chines literatur world someth mute monkey could done fact despit base one icon piec chines literatur ever stori isnt much conced might im entir unfamiliar journey west think forgiven expect standalon game tell stori second third fourth game seri sure know what go im put firm grip narr instanc stori dump come form music video drop middl brandnew area biom mighti nicelook biom mind grant theyr kind nicelook that better pretti screenshot instead practic intuit level design chapter area big felt like spend time run around tri hunt secret sinc want get much game possibl becam annoy grant appreci develop put huge area missabl secret game cool help futur critic path stuff make worth player time effort engag side content world bloat game like assassin creed star war outlaw side content that worth engag huge plu still level design becam almost unbear chapter tri spot small interestinglook area fli around cloud look bad belong game know made pretti environ pretti inde pleas make inevit sequel game trim fat make area smaller add better indic what pile rubbl that worth climb isnt let peopl focu best part game combat combat best part gameparticularli visual impress bossesstil set baggag there robust set skill tree arent realli build wukong plenti option shake play style probabl mani skill tree option unlik path exil look wukong skill tree doesnt make want puke low bar clear clear wukong biggest issu combat doesnt work half time idea work game long hang hat combat somehow aerial heavi attack dont connect insan mani time would walk stationari enemi jump air use heavi attack hit connect game spent year develop issu hit aerial heavi attack game decid take nap job enemi hitbox hurtbox gener arent good mani attack would miss enemi bigger apart wiggl inch left cours rule doesnt appli interest fair destin one decid expand hurtbox twice normal size either side except your rock solidth game parryform enemi attack often conveni miss your rock solid form rock solid one first spell wont work half time there bug use immobil spell boss wont work boss hit anyway spell cooldown im give develop benefit doubt say bug intent game design immobil spell immobil use inexcus even spell work there chunk boss dont let use youll use immobil essenti plot armor kick say dont get use spell nope doesnt matter mani point invest spell dont get use boss game say cant top boss fight horrend design tip point make realiz game wasnt fun despit game get easier went thank upgrad dev made sure studi manu father abyss make sure got spastic flail right least worst singl attack boss arsen lost mystic art random fp dropyellow loong erlang two boss fight except bad make sure stock elden ring flail combo along plenti pois trait share normal enemi reason ensur got annoy possibl decid youv much fun got play game much make sure take air year let contempl sin win hard know perhap that line game theme disappointingli wukong game numer small irrit surround core someth could much better game take around hour complet much content possibl numer small irrit start mount pile point game best purchas sale least issu get iron

"2023 I've been a long-time Total War fan for over a decade, but the Warhammer trilogy is what truly got me invested in the franchise. I've bought every single DLC for TWWH series since the first game released in 2016. However, the latest price hike and CA's so-called justification for their decision have left nothing but sour taste in my mouth. I would understand the price hike if the DLC contained more content, or if CA was actually increasing pay for its employees, but neither is the case. They are evidently trying to recoup losses incurred by poor financial decision made by their executives. That burden should not fall on the fans. This game still CAN be something special - fans WILL buy contents for this game years to come if CA puts effort into them. But lack of bug fixes, consistent communication, and justifiable pricing will be the downfall of the community if they persist. To the average CA employee: I still support you and all the hard work you've put into the franchise. I hope the CA execs realize they're fumbling the golden egg they're sitting on.",ive longtim total war fan decad warhamm trilog truli got invest franchis ive bought everi singl dlc twwh seri sinc first game releas howev latest price hike ca socal justif decis left noth sour tast mouth would understand price hike dlc contain content ca actual increas pay employe neither case evid tri recoup loss incur poor financi decis made execut burden fall fan game still someth special fan buy content game year come ca put effort lack bug fix consist commun justifi price downfal commun persist averag ca employe still support hard work youv put franchis hope ca exec realiz theyr fumbl golden egg theyr sit

"2022 Its hard to put into words the joy Elden Ring has brought me. Rarely do I see a game where you can explore and fight your way through a huge fantasy world, with so many functional builds to play as, and just so much to explore and so much to see, stuff to find that actually matters for the improvement of your character, and unique underground and hidden areas to find.It expertly blends the grand sense of adventure and discovery in the open world, with the tighter more focused exploration of its large 'dungeon' type areas.. while while blended seamlessly with the surrounding world, also feel like a self-contained experience that is more traditionally Dark Souls like in a lot of ways. You'll see what I mean when you get into Stormveil Castle for the first time and see how the feel of the gameplay shifts to something veterans of the Souls series will feel more at home with.I also think it does a good job of making the game a little more accessible to players who found From's similar games to be too difficult, while still offering a challenge. I particularly like how the world allows you alternatives to just trying to push forward when you're having difficulty.. It's a simple matter to just abandon the area or boss that is giving you trouble, and trying your luck elsewhere for a while.. and maybe out there you'll go up in stats, find some more charges for your Flask, improve your weapons or find better gear, obtain some new magic or learn how to craft a helpful item, and also hone your own abilities as a player with practice without frustration.. then when you come back, that impossible boss won't seem so hard anymore.I love this game.

"2023 I want to recommend this game. I do - I enjoyed WH2 a lot and have some fun moments in WH3. But there are just stupid problems in this game considering it is a direct successor to WH2, and design choices that are just not good.There are still bugs in the game well over a year after release. Ranged units have a hard time firing at targets correctly. Armies can get stuck on agents and be frozen indefinitely. Random crashes can happen in battle maps. Several unit descriptions just don't even match what they actually do/are functionally.The AI are brain dead during sieges. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I think the main settlement sieges are the worst in ANY total war game since Empire. The defender is actually WORSE off than the attacker with the new capture point system. Defenses don't work all that well. Walls are still worthless. The AI can't defend their settlements for ♥♥♥♥. It is such an epic fail and makes sieges just a pain on both ends. I hate them.Several of the older races (Empire, Dwarves, Dark Elves especially) just feel bland now in immortal empires. The Empires mechanics are terrible. Cathay isn't a finished race. Bretonnia needs attention. Realms of Chaos is a bad campaign, pure and simple. It just isn't all that good. Id welcome arguments to the contrary, but it wasn't well executed for the original characters on release and was insulting that they released WH3 with the game being UNFINISHED. Immortal Empires wasn't out yet. And Cathay wasn't finished and still doesn't feel finished. The new chaos dwarves feel much more fleshed out than they do.CA is half assing a lot of their content. It is infuriating to see. They are capable of doing a much better job, and I cannot recommend any product from them in good faith while they keep putting out games, DLCs and other updates that just aren't up to snuff. Unfinished, unpolished, untested. And they expect us to accept it for what it is, test it for them and wait for months to have proper changes.

"2023 To be honest, CS2's performance is completely below expectations. After such a long polishing process, the outcome is quite disappointing. Ignoring the existing bugs, which I assume will be fixed in future updates, the main issues for me are the strange feel of the weapons and odd feedback on headshots, giving a waxy sensation. The game's visuals, perhaps due to my unfamiliarity, seem tiring, with overly bright brightness. Despite expecting to adapt quickly to lower graphics settings as in CS:GO, it's evident that the experience lacks the satisfying feeling of the GO era. Lastly, it feels like CS2 is leaning towards CF, and while some added features like throwable monitoring aren't necessarily bad, they seem unnecessary, adding an extra layer that might be considered superfluous. Ultimately, having spent my entire university period with this game, I hope CS2 can carry the legacy and I trust Valve to refine it. We've seen the significant improvements brought by Source 2, and I believe CS2 has substantial untapped potential.",honest perform complet expect long polish process outcom quit disappoint ignor exist bug assum fix futur updat main issu strang feel weapon odd feedback headshot give waxi sensat game visual perhap due unfamiliar seem tire overli bright bright despit expect adapt quickli lower graphic set csgo evid experi lack satisfi feel go era lastli feel like lean toward cf ad featur like throwabl monitor arent necessarili bad seem unnecessari ad extra layer might consid superflu ultim spent entir univers period game hope carri legaci trust valv refin weve seen signific improv brought sourc believ substanti untap potenti
"Sleeping with a big floofy Cat literally improves your sanity 10/10For real though; the game has issues, definitely needs some work, but is still a lot of fun in its current state.Base building is pretty basic, and is probably the most jank part of this game, so I hope to see more variety and improvements in the future.The story isn't all that interesting. But to be fair, it seems like gameplay was the primary focus here. Which is fine.Enemy design, particularly the more unique ones, are very creative and amazing for a first encounter.For gameplay, it feels like a mix of Rust and The Division. Thankfully, PvP isn't required. I enjoy a more casual PvE experience, with small instances of PvP thrown in there via Events, which are occasionally available.Seasonal wipes have been a concern for many, definitely not for everyone, but I think it keeps things fresh while allowing you to keep some things like currencies, skins, blueprints, etc, which are the main time sinks. Leveling, gearing, and building are fairly quick and easy, especially with some experience, so so I wouldn't consider it a negative. If anything, it makes the game more approachable to new players at the start of every season.As of writing, the only monetization within the game is purely cosmetic. Let's hope it stays that way.For a free to play game, I'm quite happy with it.

"Gonna be completely honest, after the first 30 minutes of optimization hell, I am safe to say that the early trials were worth it. A story that sticks to the core of 40k, the beautiful, immersive set pieces. This is THE 40k game I've been waiting for. The combat system has taken some time to get used to, but there's nothing more satisfying than pulling off a chain of executions and heavy hitting slams into the horde that surrounds you (before you turn the entire place into a red mist). And it's not just the melee. The ranged weapons have the most satisfying bolter punches I've seen in a 40k game yet. The multiplayer PVP mode could use some balancing, and the campaign AI really needs a tweak or two, but this is something that nobody is a stranger to at this point. It's an expected headache when you make gameplay surrounding co-op and then give us robots with the brains of a sloth to back us up.I accidentally purchased the early access pre-order, but as far as I'm concerned, it's been worth every penny, and will be for a long time to come.

"The obvious souls-like references aside, something this game does that i find quite interesting; Boss fights in this game play out more like a traditional arcade fighting game, like Tekken.Bosses moves have more mixups and they tend to try and bait/trick you into trying to punish a lot of times. The moves also can be chained from their various moveset making combos you really do not anticipate. There are very few ""combo ender"" moves where you are guranteed a safe punish so most times you'll need to poke with some risks or go for a combo with major risks.As an example the Black Bear Guai, the final boss of chapter 1, has a few generic attacks that he can do such as combo A of 1-2-3 or or combo B of 1-2. At times he could use less than the combo's full string (such as combo A 1-2 but no 3). That's typical of Soulslike. However, at times, you would see something like combo A 1-2 into combo B 1-2. Another mixup of combo A 1-2-3 - pause into combo ender X (Body slam) to punish people who like to poke (You can still dodge it if your reflexes are fast enough).Sometimes there would even be combo B 1 - pause and then into combo A 1-2 - pause again to throw off the rhythm.Very rarely, the boss would spam a chain of attacks such as combo A 1-2-3 into combo B 1-2 into combo ender Y (double hand slam).It's nice to see a pretty innovative take on the soulslike fighting style as well as emphasis on boss fights as opposed to exploration/common enemies.",obviou soulslik refer asid someth game find quit interest boss fight game play like tradit arcad fight game like tekkenboss move mixup tend tri baittrick tri punish lot time move also chain variou moveset make combo realli anticip combo ender move gurante safe punish time youll need poke risk go combo major risksa exampl black bear guai final boss chapter gener attack combo combo b time could use less combo full string combo that typic soulslik howev time would see someth like combo combo b anoth mixup combo paus combo ender x bodi slam punish peopl like poke still dodg reflex fast enoughsometim would even combo b paus combo paus throw rhythmveri rare boss would spam chain attack combo combo b combo ender doubl hand slamit nice see pretti innov take soulslik fight style well emphasi boss fight oppos explorationcommon enemi
"2022 The game was rushed to release and that is painfully easy to see not only by all the performance issues and bugs at the release date (even after the delay of the original release date from 2021 to 2022), but also by reading through the Roadmap that was revealed today, in which reflects how poorly the release is actually going when it comes to fixing issues and getting basic content out for players.With the game not being in Early Access or tagged as such, having loyal consumers having to wait at least 6 months just to have what you would call ""staples"" or ""basics"" of the TW Warhammer games such as the Blood DLC pack and the Immortal empires mode (and only a Beta at that time with the final and proper release only at the end of the year in Q4) is truly inexcusable.Update: After one year in ""Early Access"" the game keeps having a lot of unresolved issues and they are getting more greedy and trying to gouge fans as they go you just need to take a look at the upcoming Chaos Dwarves DLC pricing.Just check the new DLC Shadows of Change to be released soon, they keep gouging prices for DLCs that have a low amount of new content with recycled units.Update 2:You know developers and the entire company lost their plot when they are putting official statements to their community with phrases such as: ""The right to discuss is a privilege—it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game""The only thing I wish is that they start on capitalizing on a massively opportunity for their own IP, ""Total War: Clown Fiesta"" complete with a gazillion overpriced DLCs to compensate for the failure of Hyenas, the ongoing Early AccessTM for Total Warhammer III and copy paste Total War Pharaoh.",game rush releas pain easi see perform issu bug releas date even delay origin releas date also read roadmap reveal today reflect poorli releas actual go come fix issu get basic content playerswith game earli access tag loyal consum wait least month would call stapl basic tw warhamm game blood dlc pack immort empir mode beta time final proper releas end year truli inexcusableupd one year earli access game keep lot unresolv issu get greedi tri goug fan go need take look upcom chao dwarv dlc pricingjust check new dlc shadow chang releas soon keep goug price dlc low amount new content recycl unitsupd know develop entir compani lost plot put offici statement commun phrase right discuss privilegeit entitl earn play gameth thing wish start capit massiv opportun ip total war clown fiesta complet gazillion overpr dlc compens failur hyena ongo earli accesstm total warhamm iii copi past total war pharaoh

It's frankly alarming that they feel they're able to fairly openly say ""We have to pay a lot of money to fund our other games and pet projects so pay up the extra cash for this DLC or you'll get nothing else on the game you actually like"" and it doesn't occur to them that consumers obviously aren't going to be on board with that.If you're already playing a game in the Total War: Warhammer series and enjoying it you probably already bought Total War: Warhammer 3 and feel about it however you will.

Those same reviewers have since booted the launch version of the game to find a 30-ish% hit to FPS on the same hardware and settings. Performance is even worse in windowed mode but full screen mode results in frequent crashes if you ever alt-tab out.Shame because it’s a fun game, just currently crippled by boneheaded anti-piracy software that punishes paying customers.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

It's a gamble whether you'll have fine performance or worse than normal, even on lowest settings. It seems like the copies they gave content creators did NOT have Denuvo, and thus the performance issues, and they added it upon launch so that nobody would be able to take it into account for reviews. That is an absolutely abhorrent thing to do. Something tells me this is a move on SEGA's part, but either way, it should not be tolerated. From this point on, I'd say keep your money, wait until AFTER launch from CA to decide whether or not to buy the game.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

I feel like I SHOULD recommend this game. But it is functionally broken on release. I can't encourage people to alpha test this game for CA at the cost of their own money. I have 32GB of Ram and 8GB of VRAM (RTX 3060). The game barely runs. This is mind boggling because of the HUGE advancements that CA has made optimizing TWWH2! Honestly I still have plenty of mileage to get out of the second game and I'll be playing that while they fix this one. I am 100% positive in a year this game will be incredible and have some excellent DLCs I will certainly buy and a great mortal empires mode. But until it's optimized, the UI is fixed and most importantly they fix the INSANE unit control issues I cannot recommend this game.Seriously the unit control is COMPLETELY broken. I'm not sure if they playtested this build at all. Your units WILL stop moving and stand still and ignore orders. To get ANY melee unit to engage a ANY ranged unit thats running you have to literally sit there and click on them for the ENTIRE time, which you obviously cannot do when you have a 40 unit army. All the other issues WOULD be tolerable. I can deal with some crashing and framerate drops, I can't handle the game actually being unplayable and broken. When your level 40 doomstack skarbrand dies to a single unit of archers because he was afk for legit only 20 seconds because he got a charge off on the unit then fell asleep basically ruins the entire game. Every single one of your units will do this and its exacerbated by more than half the factions represented in the main campaign being ranged focused or hybrid.TL:DR DO NOT play right now. Wait for the game to actually finish it's development cycle and this will be a masterpiece, similar to how TWWH2 went from a 6/10 to 10/10 in 3 years. This game WILL be amazing, but if you are on the fence then he at least you know you'll get the game for 10-20 bucks later when all of US have finished alpha testing it for you.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

This likely would not be the case if it shipped with Mortal Empires on day one, and did not elect to release without add the very least a skin-and-bones placeholder version of the Chaos Dwarves, instead using Orks as a placeholder.The game itself runs somewhat poorly, it is not well optimized, however this can be mitigated by running at a decreased resolution and lowered textures. This, however, is entirely temporary, and shouldn't factor into your interest, but only your interest *immediately*. Unless you're a huge fan of Kislev, Cathay, Chaos, or the Ogre Kingdoms, I would highly suggest DELAYING your purchase until the future when there is more content to be had, as your time will likely be better spent in Warhammer II where you will still have access to the content from Warhammer I and II.That being said, Chaos is an extremely well designed faction from a gameplay standpoint and has some unique mechanics that stand out from anything else Creative Assembly has ever made. Having tried out the first several turns of most factions by now, I can safely, but unfortunately say that the Legion of Chaos is by far my favorite, which is unfortunate to me because I was mostly looking forward to the Ogre Kingdoms.As for the Campaign, it is about as sandboxy as Vortex was, but with a new mechanic involving the invasion of each realm of Chaos to slay a Daemon Prince, as opposed to completing rituals as in Warhammer II. I personally enjoy it.Lastly, the minor settlements and siege battles. I am not as adverse to the change as other people are. While the supply system is bizarre at best, I'm not convinced that it is entirely detrimental to gameplay, after playing a few rounds, however, I would appreciate a setting to be able to disable this mechanic and return to the old design. I do enjoy the designs of the maps, though, and I really like the new survival mode for custom battles.At it's current state I would suggest waiting for further updates unless you're a die-hard fan of Total War Fantasy or any of the Races in Warhammer III, barring of course Chaos Dwarves.I run an old AM3 CPU, 8gb of DDR3 RAM, and a GTX 1050ti, which is an extremely obsolete setup for this game. However, after twiddling with the settings, Im able to run the game at about 57fps, which is tolerable to me. It is possible for me to gain almost 100fps at very low settings, but the blurriness strains my eyes.I'd give it about a 7/10 right now. You might enjoy it, conditionally, but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.READ MORE Was this review helpful?

"2014 Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added.The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving.

"Problems With the Progression System The current progression system in an otherwise great game is a turn-off and is going to drive would be players away from sticking with the game as it evolves over the course of its road map Separate Cosmetic and Class Progression Having a single currency, Requisitions, be required to progress these categories puts players in a position where they are going to make mistakes as they try to kit out their preferred Astartes Chapter. Players will be in search of the correct right shoulder insignia or company pauldron trim paint and this means sacrificing progression of class skills. There is no explanation of this risk to a new player and the system itself is so frustrating its easy to have level 15 in a class and not be able to afford even the first row of its perks. Class skills should just unlock at the appropriate level. There should be no need to also buy them with Requisitions. The amount of Requisitions for victory should be increased at each difficulty level. You should still receive a reduced amount of Requisitions for mission failure. Continue to require victory to progress in unlocking distinct armor parts. Weapon Progression is Simply A Bad Approach The weapon system is convoluted and tying better weapons behind higher difficulty is a guaranteed way to drive players away out of frustration. The Minimal difficulty in this game is hard and recommending ""Level 5"" to players to take on the next difficulty tier is meaningless if they have spent their Requisitions on cosmetics instead of their class skills. Mastery tokens should simply be removed from the game. As you progress experience on a weapon class the perks should also just unlock without having to acquire a mastery token. Locking the Armory Data required to advance a weapon class to its higher tier is a bad formula. Some players will never be able to achieve those weapon data tiers and as such will remain stuck at a lower difficulty without a means to improve their offensive abilities beyond a point. Armory Data needs an exchange system such as 5 Green can exchange for 1 Purple as so on. This system also needs FAR better in game tools and tutorials without everyone having to refer to out of date early access review information or Reddit posts trying to figure out how this all works Potential But Also Potential To Die Fast This game is going to draw a lot of attention when it fully launches. People will be excited about playing as a Space Marine. Even with the above suggested changes the game is going to be a GRIND to progress. When players find out their progress is also heavily skill gated in what is a seriously difficult game they will move on to the next thing. Its important to preserve the high difficulty for players who have the skill and want that challenge. its equally important that the perks and equipment necessary to play on higher difficulties become available to players of lower skill and that the systems involved here be retooled quickly or this game will end up with a very small player base of nothing but hardcore difficulty seekers. The entire backbone of what is otherwise a great game, its progression systems, are a total miss and I hope you take the above as constructive criticism to improve the game and sustain your audience while you still have the opportunity to do so.I cannot recommend this game until the progression system and economy for multiplayer are addressed, not at the full price asking point.",problem progress system current progress system otherwis great game turnoff go drive would player away stick game evolv cours road map separ cosmet class progress singl currenc requisit requir progress categori put player posit go make mistak tri kit prefer astart chapter player search correct right shoulder insignia compani pauldron trim paint mean sacrif progress class skill explan risk new player system frustrat easi level class abl afford even first row perk class skill unlock appropri level need also buy requisit amount requisit victori increas difficulti level still receiv reduc amount requisit mission failur continu requir victori progress unlock distinct armor part weapon progress simpli bad approach weapon system convolut tie better weapon behind higher difficulti guarante way drive player away frustrat minim difficulti game hard recommend level player take next difficulti tier meaningless spent requisit cosmet instead class skill masteri token simpli remov game progress experi weapon class perk also unlock without acquir masteri token lock armori data requir advanc weapon class higher tier bad formula player never abl achiev weapon data tier remain stuck lower difficulti without mean improv offens abil beyond point armori data need exchang system green exchang purpl system also need far better game tool tutori without everyon refer date earli access review inform reddit post tri figur work potenti also potenti die fast game go draw lot attent fulli launch peopl excit play space marin even suggest chang game go grind progress player find progress also heavili skill gate serious difficult game move next thing import preserv high difficulti player skill want challeng equal import perk equip necessari play higher difficulti becom avail player lower skill system involv retool quickli game end small player base noth hardcor difficulti seeker entir backbon otherwis great game progress system total miss hope take construct critic improv game sustain audienc still opportun soi recommend game progress system economi multiplay address full price ask point

"Space Marine 2Let me preface by saying this is more a list of pros and cons and is biased entirely towards the melee experience, I have played Assault religiously. I love real difficulty, not the artificial crap but the real stuff. Payday 2 DSOD, VM2 Cataclysm and Onslaught, Darktide Auric Storm and countless other hellish experiences. Space Marine 2 absolutely has the ability to deliver this with some fine-tuning in the future but the current experience is rough around the edges the longer you play and advance. Despite that, I believe this game is worth it, and the developers should be supported.Pros: An incredibly beautiful and heartfelt experience, the developers actively listen and respond to the community, clearly care about the source material and they've created some of the most beautiful graphics to immerse yourself in the carnage.Melee combat just clicks, perfect parries, perfect dodges, gunstrikes, beautiful executions. The first few hours you play will blow your mind away, not to mention the difficulty and initial learning curve is perfect.Cons: Critical flaws in the nuances of the pure melee experience: I'd be here all day breaking this down but to put it as simple as possible: If there were 50 melee enemies after me, I can and have beat them before with use of all the aforementioned mechanics alongside the memorised combos they do, but if you were to add just even 3 small ranged units shooting me 50 metres away, I'm dead in probably 20 seconds and there is nothing skillful I can do to counter this as Assault, my preferred class. Assault is easily the weakest because it lacks utility, functionality, and a worthwhile ability; the strongest and most efficient use of the Assault's jump-pack is to simply stall and run away when the chips are down so you can get reinforcements. Vanguard mogs Assault having played both classes, not just in melee efficiency but in immense measurable utility for yourself and team. Spongy and nonreactive enemy rosters: Did I mention they take countless melee attacks? They do not give a damn. Thunderhammer in their face? They do not care, they will just attack. Jump pack attack or charged attack? Nah they get Insane I-frame dodges that break your tracking and teleports that can actually send them behind walls and covers and allow them to instantly counter attack with an unblockable flame attack, SUCK IT Astartes trash! Behold the trickery of Tzeentch! Thousand sons roster: Take every con I've mentioned, now play on the hardest difficulty, now crank it from a 7 to an 11. They. Are. Overtuned. The issues of a pure melee experience is exasperated 100-fold when you play assault against them. Every Majoris enemy will teleport away before you can kill them with melee, this becomes a problem when they teleport off-screen or into a pack of 20 other different chaos marines. You will whittle them down slowly but never be able to efficiently take them down, though this feels very in their ballpark, it just feels plain bad. At least give me a way to counter this. Here is the irony, Extremis thousand sons are easier to kill. Yeah, no seriously, they really are, I can easily parry and perfect dodge their moves and finish them off because they do not teleport away. Every single unit is overtuned.TZAANGORS: IF YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW. I HAVE SPENT 10 ENTIRE SECONDS PRESSING NOTHING BUT PARRY, REACTING TO THEIR JUMPS. THERE IS 0 COUNTERPLAY OR OPPORTUNITY BEYOND THIS, ANY OTHER OPTION WILL RESULT IN HEALTH LOSS. THEY WILL ACTIVELY DISREGARD ANY ATTACK YOU DO AGAINST THEM, HYPER ARMOUR OUT THE WAZOO. No probs if you have a melta though, looking at you Vanguard.Cheap Chinese Crap: The manufactorium unfortunately, does not provide. Instead we have the ali-express power armour that disintegrates when even looked at the wrong way.

"Product received for free Black Myth: Wukong is not the game that you think it is. The opening is strong, with gorgeous visuals, incredible art direction and mystifying enemy and boss design. The problems begin however when the introduction is over and the real game begins. Black Myth Wukong dresses itself as an RPG but this is only superficial. In reality, Black Myth Wukong is a Boss Rush. There's very little downtime between boss fights, often moving directly from one fight into another. When there is something in-between, the game offers only linear levels with nothing in the way of exploration.That's not to say that the game isn't entirely without merit. Visually the game is a feast for the eyes, and the music and sound design are top quality. The combat system is as visually pleasing as it is mechanically deep, there's an array of skills, spells, transformations, items and equipment at the players disposal.However, this variety is hampered by the totally linear progression, armour and weapons are not found in the game world, they are unlocked in the shop after an arbitrary amount of progress has been made. Likewise for spells and skills which are only unlocked after specific points of the story. This leaves the game severely lacking in player agency, there's no decision making in where to go or in what order you progress the story, each ""level"" of the game is a beautifully decorated corridor with a boss waiting for you at the end and even within a scant few hours, the shallow game-play loop becomes immediately apparent. The boss rush nature of the game falls flat without the framing behind it. Bosses that have fantastic visual design have no framing within the story, there's little to no lore or explanation behind the enemies you're facing and it can leave you erratically jumping from one quirky boss fight to another with a feeling of disconnect. Without this framing, the significance of the boss is lost and what could have been a grandiose fight becomes a pedestrian affair, each boss becomes just another box to tick on your road to the end of the game.Black Myth: Wukong is a spectacle, for sure, but it feels like it's using that spectacle as a crutch to distract from how little depth there to the gameplay, it feels like all of the mechanics of a good RPG were created, they just forgot to create the world to go with it.",product receiv free black myth wukong game think open strong gorgeou visual incred art direct mystifi enemi boss design problem begin howev introduct real game begin black myth wukong dress rpg superfici realiti black myth wukong boss rush there littl downtim boss fight often move directli one fight anoth someth inbetween game offer linear level noth way explorationthat say game isnt entir without merit visual game feast eye music sound design top qualiti combat system visual pleas mechan deep there array skill spell transform item equip player disposalhowev varieti hamper total linear progress armour weapon found game world unlock shop arbitrari amount progress made likewis spell skill unlock specif point stori leav game sever lack player agenc there decis make go order progress stori level game beauti decor corridor boss wait end even within scant hour shallow gameplay loop becom immedi appar boss rush natur game fall flat without frame behind boss fantast visual design frame within stori there littl lore explan behind enemi your face leav errat jump one quirki boss fight anoth feel disconnect without frame signific boss lost could grandios fight becom pedestrian affair boss becom anoth box tick road end gameblack myth wukong spectacl sure feel like use spectacl crutch distract littl depth gameplay feel like mechan good rpg creat forgot creat world go

In my opinion, to get straight to the point: Blackmyth Wukong is a solid game but by no means outstanding or a Game of the Year contender.First, the positive aspects:- Graphics & Atmosphere: This cannot be taken away from the game. The graphics are by far the best I have ever seen in a game. The texture details, the light-shadow balance, and the general look of the game are simply breathtaking.The animations are incredibly well done; for example, the animation changes when you swing into an attack from a dodge move compared to a normal attack. This creates a high level of realism and atmosphere.- Soundtrack: The soundtrack is wonderfully composed and greatly enhances the boss fights and overall atmosphere.- Cinematic Presentation and Cutscenes: The animations at the end of a chapter are absolute masterpieces. (Though I didn’t understand how 4 out of 6 of them relate to the story, but fine), and the cutscenes during a fight (like in the intro or the final boss) are top-notch. This was actually the main reason why I found the game so cool.- AAA Title without Extra Costs: Few to no bugs, no cost traps, no additional content locked behind a paywall.The negative aspects:- Story: I have no knowledge of Chinese mythology and therefore perceived the story accordingly. The intro is absolutely fantastic, it really hooked me, and I was highly motivated to learn who these “gods” are, the “court,” and how to fight them. Unfortunately, this becomes completely irrelevant. You go through chapter after chapter searching for relics, and each chapter basically contains its “own” storyline. The storylines are neither interesting nor exciting. Even when you develop a connection or interest in a certain aspect of the story, the chapter ends and a different, new storyline with new characters begins. There are very few characters that span across multiple chapters. As a result, at least for me, I had no motivation to continue playing. The end of the game is, in my eyes, completely nonsensical in terms of the story and only underscores how cryptic, disjointed, and boring the story is. I feel like the game is trying hard to be like Elden Ring but fails to deliver the story like FromSoftware does.- Map and Level Design: The level design is complete garbage. You wander around for hours, there is no map, and you constantly get lost. Most of the time, the places also look so similar to each other that you almost can’t find your way around anymore. Since the game relies on very few HUD indicators (which I generally think is cool), you don’t know where to go and get lost even more. This wouldn’t be a problem if the world at least gave you a reason to explore: It doesn’t. Everything you loot consists of crafting materials. These give no motivation for exploration. Armor and weapons are only unlocked as part of the story and cannot be found in any chests.The fact that invisible walls border the map doesn’t make it any better, as you often think, ""Oh, it must continue over there,"" and then you run into an invisible wall. In my opinion, that doesn’t belong in an AAA title.- Bosses & Gameplay: The bosses are a topic of their own. Firstly, apart from the intro, the final boss, and a few exceptions, I find all bosses to be completely forgettable. They are boring, there are waaaay too maaaany of them, and they look boring too. In 90% of cases, it's a human with some animal head. Don’t get me wrong; their attacks and all the visuals are more than fantastic. But if you think you’re getting bosses like FromSoftware delivers, you’re in the wrong place.The gameplay is one of the biggest criticisms for me. Extremely monotonous and boring, especially for a game with at least 20 hours of playtime. The combos are very limited (feels like there are about three of them), and you do the same thing all the time. This not only looks boring in the long run but almost killed my desire to play. The dodging feels very satisfying but also partially very random. Often, it happened that a boss clearly hit me with an ability, and I dodged a second later, but the game registered it as a perfect dodge. Also, the hitboxes are so random; I don't know if these are bugs or just poor hitbox design. And when you've been hammering away at a boss with the same three moves for 15 minutes and then die from a hit that clearly misses, you lose your mind. Or you fight a boss who spends 90% of the time flying and is unhittable, and you're basically playing a dodge simulator.- Difficulty: As a big Soulslike fan, I love that the game is not easy. But it's a different kind of difficulty compared to the Souls series, for example. Elden Ring feels very fair in its difficulty. You learn the bosses’ patterns, their moves, and abilities, and you make it on your 50th try. In Wukong, I did not get that feeling. The game is certainly not easy, but it’s not really ""fun difficult"" either. It feels artificially hard when every boss rushes at you with endless combos, or every second boss turns invisible, or creates six copies of itself, or ten tornadoes that sweep across the map, and just touching one catapults you into the air while you still have to dodge the boss itself. Most of the time, the bosses have AoE attacks and love to dash across the entire map at you. This feels artificially and unfairly difficult. It’s like saying, ""Minecraft is the hardest game because you spawn with a wooden sword in a 10x10 room against 100 Endermen."" That’s not fun hard; that’s boring and lazy. That’s how the bosses in Wukong feel.I am very, very disappointed after having looked forward to this game so much. You can really see—and I never want to deny this—how much love went into making this game. But sometimes passion and love alone are not enough.",absolut understand mani rave review game opinion get straight point blackmyth wukong solid game mean outstand game year contenderfirst posit aspect graphic atmospher taken away game graphic far best ever seen game textur detail lightshadow balanc gener look game simpli breathtakingth anim incred well done exampl anim chang swing attack dodg move compar normal attack creat high level realism atmospher soundtrack soundtrack wonder compos greatli enhanc boss fight overal atmospher cinemat present cutscen anim end chapter absolut masterpiec though didnt understand relat stori fine cutscen fight like intro final boss topnotch actual main reason found game cool aaa titl without extra cost bug cost trap addit content lock behind paywallth neg aspect stori knowledg chines mytholog therefor perceiv stori accordingli intro absolut fantast realli hook highli motiv learn god court fight unfortun becom complet irrelev go chapter chapter search relic chapter basic contain storylin storylin neither interest excit even develop connect interest certain aspect stori chapter end differ new storylin new charact begin charact span across multipl chapter result least motiv continu play end game eye complet nonsens term stori underscor cryptic disjoint bore stori feel like game tri hard like elden ring fail deliv stori like fromsoftwar map level design level design complet garbag wander around hour map constantli get lost time place also look similar almost cant find way around anymor sinc game reli hud indic gener think cool dont know go get lost even wouldnt problem world least gave reason explor doesnt everyth loot consist craft materi give motiv explor armor weapon unlock part stori found cheststh fact invis wall border map doesnt make better often think oh must continu run invis wall opinion doesnt belong aaa titl boss gameplay boss topic firstli apart intro final boss except find boss complet forgett bore waaaay maaaani look bore case human anim head dont get wrong attack visual fantast think your get boss like fromsoftwar deliv your wrong placeth gameplay one biggest critic extrem monoton bore especi game least hour playtim combo limit feel like three thing time look bore long run almost kill desir play dodg feel satisfi also partial random often happen boss clearli hit abil dodg second later game regist perfect dodg also hitbox random dont know bug poor hitbox design youv hammer away boss three move minut die hit clearli miss lose mind fight boss spend time fli unhitt your basic play dodg simul difficulti big soulslik fan love game easi differ kind difficulti compar soul seri exampl elden ring feel fair difficulti learn boss pattern move abil make tri wukong get feel game certainli easi realli fun difficult either feel artifici hard everi boss rush endless combo everi second boss turn invis creat six copi ten tornado sweep across map touch one catapult air still dodg boss time boss aoe attack love dash across entir map feel artifici unfairli difficult like say minecraft hardest game spawn wooden sword room endermen that fun hard that bore lazi that boss wukong feeli disappoint look forward game much realli seeand never want deni thishow much love went make game sometim passion love alon enough

"2016 In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched vagina to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.",crawl counterstrik wretch vagina becom man today im task rate game one even rate motherin sixth grade would wake school start get get coupl round class call dedic sicken obsess hook cs nevermind neighbor broke hous play slept game social hub itun visual brief entryway game design didnt go far remain standout multiplay shooter pave way thing come call duti battlefieldb eight year sinc excel sourc remak valv decid time give game anoth facelift start sourc port consol becam ambiti project includ pc radic departur global offens without doubt reboot valv hit reset button seri drastic prematur maneuv may deni counterstrik remain addict reward competit shooter like
"It's an excellent game. The campaign has non stop moments of epic and memorable scenes that are packed so densely with laconian style blunt conversations and phrases that you can smell the sweat through the screen as your character regains his faith in brotherhood. There wasn't a moment where I was bored and thought to myself that the game was being padded out, I just had fun all the way through the campaign. This all is enhanced by the badass combat, where it looks like you're effortlessly cutting down the craziest monsters in rapid succession if you're playing well, while getting your face kicked in if you don't. Parrying, doging, gunstriking, armor and your melee movesets provides so much avenue to swing your big ♥♥♥♥ around, without it feeling like you're getting everything for free, because even a few little enemies can destroy you if you go afk. You're basically forced to regain health through hits, then line up gunstrikes or executions to regain armor, which protects your health against ranged. It feels so good to do because EVERYTHING can be parried and stomped into the ground, you're like a tank inching forward through the masses of enemies, without it feeling too easy. It's like Sekiro or Elden Ring, you can parry/deflect everyone's moveset with a very generous window if you make the right choices. I hope they DON'T add health regain on executions because it would make the game feel like ♥♥♥♥, because then you turn into a brain dead execution drone who doesn't even understand gunstrikes, which ruins the skill ceiling and what makes this gameplay feel so good.Operations is a PvE Coop mode alá Darktide that adds a whole bunch of RPG mechanics as you play through missions from the view point of another squad. You get a dozen classes to level up with, with passive skill trees, a lot of weapon variants that don't even exist in the campaign, getting full access to customize your armor and even having skill trees on weapons. These skill trees have just enough impact to make you feel like a god once you're progressing through them (ie. regenerating health on kill perks). It provides enough complexity and enjoyment that it feels like a fresh experience right after the campaign, which doesn't have much RPG elements at all.Seriously though, the skill ceiling of the gameplay is so rewarding that this could easily be a not recommeded if they make it easier.",excel game campaign non stop moment epic memor scene pack dens laconian style blunt convers phrase smell sweat screen charact regain faith brotherhood wasnt moment bore thought game pad fun way campaign enhanc badass combat look like your effortlessli cut craziest monster rapid success your play well get face kick dont parri doge gunstrik armor mele moveset provid much avenu swing big around without feel like your get everyth free even littl enemi destroy go afk your basic forc regain health hit line gunstrik execut regain armor protect health rang feel good everyth parri stomp ground your like tank inch forward mass enemi without feel easi like sekiro elden ring parrydeflect everyon moveset gener window make right choic hope dont add health regain execut would make game feel like turn brain dead execut drone doesnt even understand gunstrik ruin skill ceil make gameplay feel goodoper pve coop mode al darktid add whole bunch rpg mechan play mission view point anoth squad get dozen class level passiv skill tree lot weapon variant dont even exist campaign get full access custom armor even skill tree weapon skill tree enough impact make feel like god your progress ie regener health kill perk provid enough complex enjoy feel like fresh experi right campaign doesnt much rpg element allseri though skill ceil gameplay reward could easili recommed make easier

"2022 This used to be a review about how much of a mess this launch was.Let me clarify: It is still a mess. Half the factions you paid for have bugs so severe they can ruin playthroughs.When Chaos Dwarves came out I stopped playing as there was a fatal crash that came with the tooltip ""update"". This took I believe over a month to fix.The game gets no updates, some say only one dude is in charge of updates all-together and honestly, I'm at a point where I'm willing to believe it.They are pooling their money into other projects, all the while draining their succesful franchises for corporate profits. They use their employees as meat shields, saying ""costs are up!"".They've made record PROFITS. I'd be surprised if 1% of the money made from price gouging will go to employees and not the CEO who seems to be an ardent defender of this ""change"". I wonder if this could have to do with the fact CEO's make around 400 more money on average than normal workers, most of which comes from boni gained by... price gouging such as this. None of this will go to the working people, all of it will end in the pockets of people who openly despise you.Let me also here just address the elephant in the room.150% price increase. Yes, you did not misread. This is real. This is reality, as absurd as the idea of a 150% price increase sounds.Nothing more really needs to be said. They killed three kingdoms for cash. Now they're killing this. Is this CA's fault? Is it SEGA's fault? Does it matter?Do not support it. This game, the people behind it, do not respect you.And don't be a fool, you can buy a good game like baldur's gate instead.And that's my recommendation, leave this accursed land of warhammer 3 and never return.",use review much mess launch waslet clarifi still mess half faction paid bug sever ruin playthroughswhen chao dwarv came stop play fatal crash came tooltip updat took believ month fixth game get updat say one dude charg updat alltogeth honestli im point im will believ itthey pool money project drain succes franchis corpor profit use employe meat shield say cost uptheyv made record profit id surpris money made price goug go employe ceo seem ardent defend chang wonder could fact ceo make around money averag normal worker come boni gain price goug none go work peopl end pocket peopl openli despis youlet also address eleph price increas ye misread real realiti absurd idea price increas soundsnoth realli need said kill three kingdom cash theyr kill ca fault sega fault matterdo support game peopl behind respect youand dont fool buy good game like baldur gate insteadand that recommend leav accurs land warhamm never return

"2014 Introduction:Counter Strike: Global Offensive is a multiplayer FPS game where you are either part of a Terrorist organisation or part of a team of Counter-Terrorists. The aim of the game is to work together with your team to defeat the opposing force. Even with many new maps, weapons and features, this game still has some classic maps and guns from the older Counter Strike games.Pros:-Over 20 different weapons to choose from.-Many game modes including casual, death match, arms race, competitive and more.-Unique skins and possible drops at the end of each match.-Operations that feature new community-made maps and skins.Cons:-Trolls, hackers and smurfs can ruin a competitive match.-In general, the game does not have a very friendly/kind community.-Some in-game items/features can be quite costly.-Competitive bans may last as long as a week.Overall:CS:GO can be addictive at times and is a lot more fun when playing with friends. The graphics are nice and I personally enjoy the music/sounds. Communicating and working well with your team can be a huge advantage to the game, but there are those who prefer to stray away from the rest of their teammates and play by their own rules.

"2016 Counter-Strike: Global OffensivePros of the game: A new additional line of weapons to play around with, each having better improvements to handling. Though beware, some updates can nerf these, since CS:GO patches can be unreliable at times. Cool and stylish weapon graphics you can purchase over the market for personalising your own, unique firearm selections. The new game mode selections of competitive, casual, death-match, arms race (formally known as gun-game), and demolition. A whole new range of maps on top of the remastered originals. All the more Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist skins players will have featured during different level matches. They've laid off including the 'lifetime stats' section a fair bit, with only game achievements this time featured on player profiles, making it much more pleasant for perfectionists like myself instead of feeling like always needing to improve on things all the more. I can just get that sense gnawing at me sometimes to ‘do better’ when I always have to see stats in my face, even with it already sound. The achievements themselves being lesser in kill counts for weapons than before, making it much more tolerable and faster to get through. Having the addition of game music, such as the main menu theme, the match-starting theme and the victory themes are quite nice for a game jingle. Plus the addition of custom theme tracks you can get for your client.Cons of the game: The match-making system for Competitive having constant flaws. Competitive players you can come across in 80% of random matches being complete idiots and / or trolls, as well as those who try to get the whole team to surrender from a 'bad start' at the beginning of a game itself - even if you're carrying to give a worthwhile chance. To put it simple; the majority of games have players who are absolutely horrendous at listening to team tactics, then can also try kicking you thinking they’re a 'top-gun', when in reality they’re the ones who suck. Basically; you never got this in CS:S, as everyone knew the usual play of routine and worked together. In this it just seems to have gone right out the window. There's still players you will come across who hack and use aim-bot, walls, etc, legitimately (and not just as some cry out with people hacking since they're actually good). The liberty at least is the game features a player reporting system you can consult while playing, where you can submit a claim for staff to investigate if you feel a player is literally hacking. If they're found guilty; you'll have a confirmation message show up later on your main menu screen that action had been taken against them - most commonly being banned from community servers. As with the Counter-Strike franchise; there shall always be unfortunate hit-box issues - with the all familiar problem of blood splatter appearing on an enemy, yet they have no or hardly any damage rendered at all.Competitive is a joke really. You’re not even getting anything for wins besides a pointless ‘rank’ score (which at that is only effected by your chance of having MVP’s and winning, and not your actual kill / death score as it should be based upon), and if you know you’re good - you’re good. Even getting to 'Legendary Eagle' prior myself, I’m frankly not caring anymore or playing consecutively, as it’s so boring without proper teams of friends like back in CS:S league matches. The 'weapon crates' from the point system you actually have to fork out more than they're worth to open, usually getting something cheap wasting your money.Personal feedback rating: 7.5 out of 10.",counterstrik global offensivepro game new addit line weapon play around better improv handl though bewar updat nerf sinc csgo patch unreli time cool stylish weapon graphic purchas market personalis uniqu firearm select new game mode select competit casual deathmatch arm race formal known gungam demolit whole new rang map top remast origin counterterrorist terrorist skin player featur differ level match theyv laid includ lifetim stat section fair bit game achiev time featur player profil make much pleasant perfectionist like instead feel like alway need improv thing get sens gnaw sometim better alway see stat face even alreadi sound achiev lesser kill count weapon make much toler faster get addit game music main menu theme matchstart theme victori theme quit nice game jingl plu addit custom theme track get clientcon game matchmak system competit constant flaw competit player come across random match complet idiot troll well tri get whole team surrend bad start begin game even your carri give worthwhil chanc put simpl major game player absolut horrend listen team tactic also tri kick think theyr topgun realiti theyr one suck basic never got css everyon knew usual play routin work togeth seem gone right window there still player come across hack use aimbot wall etc legitim cri peopl hack sinc theyr actual good liberti least game featur player report system consult play submit claim staff investig feel player liter hack theyr found guilti youll confirm messag show later main menu screen action taken commonli ban commun server counterstrik franchis shall alway unfortun hitbox issu familiar problem blood splatter appear enemi yet hardli damag render allcompetit joke realli your even get anyth win besid pointless rank score effect chanc mvp win actual kill death score base upon know your good your good even get legendari eagl prior im frankli care anymor play consecut bore without proper team friend like back css leagu match weapon crate point system actual fork theyr worth open usual get someth cheap wast moneyperson feedback rate

"2023 The replayability on this game is astounding - and its really fun to play with friends. Now, buying all the requisite base-games is costly (and all the Skaven related DLC) unless you are getting it on a Steam sale - but that's nothing new.Earlier this year, CA released a DLC called ""Forge of the Chaos Dwarves,"" an ALL NEW race with neat new mechanics and units, consisting of 3 legendary lords. It was well received by basically all and launched with minimal (or next to 0) issues - it is by far one of my fav factions to play, personally. It cost $25. Now, CA's Executives and Board are releasing a lord pack, ""Shadows of Change,"" and it simply doesn't stack up based on the value proposition that they themselves have established with the Chaos Dwarves DLC. ""Shadows"" is the same price, but includes NO new races, and NO revolution in mechanics, and very FEW new units. Apparently the Kislev lord is also bugged to the point of unplayability. I'm not getting Shadows of Change, because it doesn't live up to the value proposition that CA itself established earlier this year... Total War is CA's biggest property, but instead of ""training their strengths"" by giving TW:Warhammer the time and attention the game needs, the Executives and Board are clearly plowing Total War profits into their derivative Fort-Valerant clone and inevitable failure of a game called ""Hyenas."" Pathetic.CA Executives and Board members are clearly a bunch of out-of-touch hacks who know nothing of business. Do they not know that chasing after ""other audiences"" to the detriment of your core products has not worked for any entertainment company - from modern cinema (writ large), to Netflix, to Disney. Are they paying attention? Do they think they are better positioned then multi-billion dollar entertainment companies who have failed at the same gamble? Games Workshop needs to revisit this partnership, and read the CA Board the riot act, or else risk the poisoning of a massive on-ramp to GW's own IP. So, I come back to what I said in the first line of this review. The replayability of this game is amazing. Therefore, I don't need this new crap DLC to make, and to keep, this game fun for me and my friends. So, I won't be buying anything from CA AT LEAST until their garbage secondary product ""Hyenas"" launches and subsequently fails.",replay game astound realli fun play friend buy requisit basegam costli skaven relat dlc unless get steam sale that noth newearli year ca releas dlc call forg chao dwarv new race neat new mechan unit consist legendari lord well receiv basic launch minim next issu far one fav faction play person cost ca execut board releas lord pack shadow chang simpli doesnt stack base valu proposit establish chao dwarv dlc shadow price includ new race revolut mechan new unit appar kislev lord also bug point unplay im get shadow chang doesnt live valu proposit ca establish earlier year total war ca biggest properti instead train strength give twwarhamm time attent game need execut board clearli plow total war profit deriv fortvaler clone inevit failur game call hyena patheticca execut board member clearli bunch outoftouch hack know noth busi know chase audienc detriment core product work entertain compani modern cinema writ larg netflix disney pay attent think better posit multibillion dollar entertain compani fail gambl game workshop need revisit partnership read ca board riot act els risk poison massiv onramp gw ip come back said first line review replay game amaz therefor dont need new crap dlc make keep game fun friend wont buy anyth ca least garbag secondari product hyena launch subsequ fail

"Very interesting game, also very flawed.Positives:No pay to winGreat art directionSolid storyOpen world stuffAbility to share base with friendsBuild varietyNegatives:Building system that will make even grown men cryLackluster PVEAwful PVP (multiple contributing factors)DesyncServer performanceClient authoritative""Did you hear that?""I spent over 500 hours across multiple accounts and servers, 160 hours on a PVE server to find out that the PVE server exclusive content, ""Prime War"" is utterly disappointing boss fight where players roll up, place rocket launcher turret, shoot a boss with some explosives, shoot a boss with some weapons and disperse.Moving on to a PVP server with multiple accounts to minimize unlucky RNG, the PVP is badly structured.While open world PVP is possible, it relies on both parties opting in to PVP status every 5-10 minutes as it automatically turns off, with no incentive to turn on PVP.Other then cargo event which is present on both PVP and PVE servers, the only meaningful PVP is territory battles, which is completely broken and barely even playable. If you happen to be able to even get in in the first place (because bugs), you need to build a defensive structure to protect your terminal, while the enemy clan and anyone else can destroy your building and kill you as you build.When the battle officially starts, you cannot build and the enemy can just drive their vehicles thru your structure (before it loads on their device) and destroy it from the inside with no counterplay, this isn't a bug btw. it's just how the game is coded. They can also shoot and kill you thru your defensive structures as long as their internet/PC is slow enough not to load these structures.In all this, there is never an incentive to actually fight, just hold W and throw boom at structure until the territory terminal dies.Oh and did I mention that after respawning the enemy cars are invisible for long enough to drive up to or inside your fort?This game had a lot of promise, but it was terribly fumbled, especially after playing Undawn (their previous game) which had both PVE and PVP content many times better, I'd even say the PVE was amazing for what it was, unfortunately that one was p2w and the game died as soon as that created large enough power gap.",interest game also flawedpositivesno pay wingreat art directionsolid storyopen world stuffabl share base friendsbuild varietynegativesbuild system make even grown men crylacklust pveaw pvp multipl contribut factorsdesyncserv performancecli authoritativedid hear thati spent hour across multipl account server hour pve server find pve server exclus content prime war utterli disappoint boss fight player roll place rocket launcher turret shoot boss explos shoot boss weapon dispersemov pvp server multipl account minim unlucki rng pvp badli structuredwhil open world pvp possibl reli parti opt pvp statu everi minut automat turn incent turn pvpother cargo event present pvp pve server meaning pvp territori battl complet broken bare even playabl happen abl even get first place bug need build defens structur protect termin enemi clan anyon els destroy build kill buildwhen battl offici start build enemi drive vehicl thru structur load devic destroy insid counterplay isnt bug btw game code also shoot kill thru defens structur long internetpc slow enough load structuresin never incent actual fight hold w throw boom structur territori termin diesoh mention respawn enemi car invis long enough drive insid fortthi game lot promis terribl fumbl especi play undawn previou game pve pvp content mani time better id even say pve amaz unfortun one game die soon creat larg enough power gap

"Elden Ring is one of those games that you just need to play at least once in your life. It's probably the closest to an actual work of art mixed in with a combo of some of FromSoft's previous games.The game's music and art direction is so perfect for the setting being presented, and felt incredibly immersive for me. The music feels as though it belongs in a movie with how dramatic and beautiful it sounds. Probably the best in FromSoft's lineup of games in my opinion. Elden Ring's art direction is also phenomenal in about every way. The only gripe I have about it, although it may be just my own opinion, is that some parts and areas get a tad redundant and some parts recycle enemies and ideas from other sections, but it's not enough to say it's bad. Open world in the game is also pretty interesting and does a decent job making sure the player always has something to do, and of course has some of the best vistas I've seen in a game. Honestly I took a little too many screenshots it's so good lmao. Seeing parts of the map that I couldn't get to made me explore looking for ways to get to where I wanted/needed to go, and rather than just being a straight shot to my destination, the game always threw a number of different things that would get me sidetracked and I'd end up going on like three other whole little adventures before doing what I set out to do. It's very good for an open world.The gameplay, I think, is a great combo of Dark Souls, Bloodbourn, and even Sekiro thrown in. FromSoft seems as though they wanted to bring the best of their older games into one, and did that they did. It really opens up the world for exploration, brings out the most interesting combat to always keep you on your toes, and has amazing locations that allow for exploration so you can find different paths through the area with many goodies to find. The story is about as insane as you'd expect. It's FromSoft.The game's insanely good, if you're reading this just thinking about getting the game just get it.

"2023 It’s a sad day when I have to write this review. TWWH is, in my very humble opinion, the best strategy game/trilogy of all time. There are grander strategies, I.E. the paradox titles, and there are more accessible titles, I.E. the Civ series. But no game does it quite like this one. Let me get my thoughts out the way, and then I’ll explain why I can’t recommend the game, although I’m sure you’ve already heard, despite me loving this title so dearly. Let’s start by saying, this is a good game. Phenomenal even. At it’s core, it’s in every sense of the word, fun. It can be brutally challenging, but is far more accessible than many of the paradox titles for example. I’ve dipped in and out of a range of strategy games (not just on steam, but Epic, GoG and growing up playing CD copies of games I still own to this day), and generally speaking, I love the genre. I grew up playing Age of Empires and Warcraft 3 before moving away from RTS games in favour of more 4X style games. Eventually moving onto grand strategy such as Total War. And let me tell you what a blast this has been. I adore this game, I’ve spent many nights up until 5/6am, just playing “one more turn!” And being late for work the following morning because I was so tired I just overslept. I’ve sat watching videos on my lunch breaks from Legend and General, I’ve fallen asleep to Total war streams, having it consume my life for a period of time. And I don’t regret a single second of it. I’ve bought copies of it full price for my friends to play so I can share that experience with others and bring them into this community. And I mention this because despite my low playtime, I genuinely love this game, and even when I’m not playing it, I’m consuming it in whatever ways I can, or being that annoying friend who pushes you to do the same. But why? Why do I think so highly of it? Well there’s just no experience quite like it. It’s easy to learn, hard to master. Despite what perceptions of it are, it’s incredibly easy to pick up and play, even if it’s a little confusing at first. The in game tutorial does a really excellent job of just teaching you the core of what you need to know, and the rest of it you’ll pick up as you play. Unlike a paradox game, it doesn’t feel like you need a YouTube guide open as mandatory training while you play (although I suppose that subjective based on skill and patience). All my research and external work has been because I’m invested and the game is so good, that it incentivises you to learn, not because it’s too complicated for it’s own good, but just because I want to improve and get better on my own terms. And unlike more casual games like Civ, where after a campaign or two, you just go through the motions, you actually have to keep atleast a small part of your brain switched on. Even at lower difficulties, you will get smashed by what can often feel like incredibly unfair AI. The game actually ends up almost feeling rogue like in nature, you play 20 turns, realise you messed up at turn 15, and then start again, using the knowledge you gained to progress further, this time getting to turn 40 and realising you made a mistake or didn’t account for something on turn 35 and repeating. It’s an incredible loop that never gets dull or boring based simply on the fact that every faction plays so uniquely to each other. From Skarbrand’s all out blitzkrieg on anything In sight, to my new personal favourite, Empire campaigns, where you slowly build up and out, playing politics and managing multiple states of affairs. I firmly believe there is a faction for anyone and everyone, and you WILL find something or someone you like in this game. I’m going to brush over gameplay and such, because I won’t lie, it’s great. As the ancient Chinese say, “It Just Works”. The overworld map is basically a relatively simple 4x style game. You have cities, ruins, towns etc, various sizes locations you can colonise to control regions, before setting out and conquering or politicking your way into others. There’s not much to say to it. It’s big, it’s fun, it’s a paint the map in your colour type of ordeal that isn’t particularly unique to this game. And then there’s the battles, where the game just blows you away. Hundreds and later at times thousands of individual units, all modelled and animated smashing into each other in the RTS style battles. You can watch as a giant T-Rex smashes it’s way through tiny little nurglings, small creatures that clump together to make large monstrosities, all while your massive great unclean one charges into ranks of lizardmen before tactically chundering and excreting all over them. It’s phenomenal and if you’re the type of person to watch AI battles on YouTube, you’ll absolutely adore it. Hundreds of battle maps, hundreds of unique units, with thousands of animations (I’m sorry I didn’t count each one but there’s a lot!). It’s immense in scale and spectacle in a way no other franchise can really rival. And most importantly, it’s fun! Winning feels great, but losing doesn’t feel bad when you watched as packs of rat men slowly swarm your empire city, each man holding the line as best they can, faith and steel binding them. It’s exciting and gorgeous. I’ve never enjoyed getting my ass handed to me so much. But onto why I can’t recommend the game. Two reasons, with one being an ongoing issue in the state of DLC, and the other being the recent actions by the developer. DLC for this game is kind of egregious. There’s going to be people who say, just buy the ones you want, but I’m not a huge fan of that mentality. The main draw of these games specifically is the immortal empires map, where all the factions across all three games play on one unified map. It’s huge, and really brings the grand into grand strategy. It’s a spectacle and genuinely an incredible feat, with 200+ factions on the map. However, of the around 80 playable lords, buying Warhammer 3 alone, only gives you access to around 15/20, which is a lot of gameplay don’t get me wrong, but with around half of those being chaos themed, and the rest being a take your pick between Slavic stew or ancient Asian hotpot, there’s not all that much variety in terms of visuals and aesthetic. To get the full experience and have the choice of playing whatever you want, you need to pay out hundreds of pounds just to get every dlc and every game and then every dlc for those games. It’s just all a bit much. It’s something total war fans have put up with, and it’s something I’ve financially supported due to having the disposable income and enjoying the games. However as a new player, imagine looking at the game thinking, I just want the complete experience, access to everything that’s in the game and finding out you’ll have to spend well over £200 just to have the option to play a race. And it’s not like you can try the races either, there’s no demo, and with campaigns lasting anywhere from 10 to 60 hours, you can’t try them and then just refund realistically. It’s something I looked past for a long time, but with recent events, I just can’t support this model anymore. And those recent events. You’ve heard about them, there’s a reason everyone is reviewing this negatively. Creative Assembly is now forcing unwarranted price increases on these already quite minimal DLCs. £20 (a third of the price of the game might I add) for three lords, no one was particularly excited or asking for, with very few additions other than that no real new units with issues coming with the ones they did add, serious bugs that they still refuse to fix or just ignore, and a frankly, quite disgusting response to fan criticism and feedback, vaguely threatening to cut support for the game should fans choose not to pay for the dlc. This is a company who’s revenue has increased by 20% over the last year, who release updates at a speed that it would be generous to call slow, all while claiming that they need to do this to keep up with the market",sad day write review twwh humbl opinion best strategi gametrilog time grander strategi ie paradox titl access titl ie civ seri game quit like one let get thought way ill explain cant recommend game although im sure youv alreadi heard despit love titl dearli let start say good game phenomen even core everi sens word fun brutal challeng far access mani paradox titl exampl ive dip rang strategi game steam epic gog grow play cd copi game still day gener speak love genr grew play age empir warcraft move away rt game favour style game eventu move onto grand strategi total war let tell blast ador game ive spent mani night play one turn late work follow morn tire overslept ive sat watch video lunch break legend gener ive fallen asleep total war stream consum life period time dont regret singl second ive bought copi full price friend play share experi other bring commun mention despit low playtim genuin love game even im play im consum whatev way annoy friend push think highli well there experi quit like easi learn hard master despit percept incred easi pick play even littl confus first game tutori realli excel job teach core need know rest youll pick play unlik paradox game doesnt feel like need youtub guid open mandatori train play although suppos subject base skill patienc research extern work im invest game good incentivis learn complic good want improv get better term unlik casual game like civ campaign two go motion actual keep atleast small part brain switch even lower difficulti get smash often feel like incred unfair ai game actual end almost feel rogu like natur play turn realis mess turn start use knowledg gain progress time get turn realis made mistak didnt account someth turn repeat incred loop never get dull bore base simpli fact everi faction play uniqu skarbrand blitzkrieg anyth sight new person favourit empir campaign slowli build play polit manag multipl state affair firmli believ faction anyon everyon find someth someon like game im go brush gameplay wont lie great ancient chines say work overworld map basic rel simpl style game citi ruin town etc variou size locat colonis control region set conquer politick way other there much say big fun paint map colour type ordeal isnt particularli uniqu game there battl game blow away hundr later time thousand individu unit model anim smash rt style battl watch giant trex smash way tini littl nurgl small creatur clump togeth make larg monstros massiv great unclean one charg rank lizardmen tactic chunder excret phenomen your type person watch ai battl youtub youll absolut ador hundr battl map hundr uniqu unit thousand anim im sorri didnt count one there lot immens scale spectacl way franchis realli rival importantli fun win feel great lose doesnt feel bad watch pack rat men slowli swarm empir citi man hold line best faith steel bind excit gorgeou ive never enjoy get ass hand much onto cant recommend game two reason one ongo issu state dlc recent action develop dlc game kind egregi there go peopl say buy one want im huge fan mental main draw game specif immort empir map faction across three game play one unifi map huge realli bring grand grand strategi spectacl genuin incred feat faction map howev around playabl lord buy warhamm alon give access around lot gameplay dont get wrong around half chao theme rest take pick slavic stew ancient asian hotpot there much varieti term visual aesthet get full experi choic play whatev want need pay hundr pound get everi dlc everi game everi dlc game bit much someth total war fan put someth ive financi support due dispos incom enjoy game howev new player imagin look game think want complet experi access everyth that game find youll spend well option play race like tri race either there demo campaign last anywher hour cant tri refund realist someth look past long time recent event cant support model anymor recent event youv heard there reason everyon review neg creativ assembl forc unwarr price increas alreadi quit minim dlc third price game might add three lord one particularli excit ask addit real new unit issu come one add seriou bug still refus fix ignor frankli quit disgust respons fan critic feedback vagu threaten cut support game fan choos pay dlc compani who revenu increas last year releas updat speed would gener call slow claim need keep market

"2022 There isn't much new to add about this game at this point so I'll try (and fail) to be concise (which is hard because the hype I've had for this game in the past years is immesurable).Are you a Souls veteran? Welcome to the best souls by a long shot. Like, DS1 will always be in my heart but it's completely surreal the amount of joy, entertainment, ""wow"" moments like the very first time you reach Anor Londo in DS1, Drangleic Castle in DS2 or Irithyll in DS3. This game has that but every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 15 minutes. Literally pick everything you liked about previous titles and Elden Ring easily has that and improved.Are you new to the Souls series? Welcome to the modern gaming experience of your life. For the first time ever we have a product that is overhyped during its development and not only it met its expectations, but somehow exceeded them. Elden Ring is the culmination of everything FromSoft has learned for the past 10 years, all put together into their first open world game. Experience freedom, mystery, danger, an absurd amount of content and varied environments, a savage attention to detail and overall one of the most beautiful and dense open worlds this market has to offer.If you feel intimidated by the Difficult tag that precedes all FromSoft's titles, let me tell you that Elden Ring is the most accessible game of them all. And by accessible I don't mean easiest. While you were forced to stomp on an area/boss in previous games, this is an open world. Feeling stuck? Just turn around, keep exploring and get stronger (and boi, there IS content to explore)! Unlike your generic big titles, don't go full unga unga here. This is a game that you can perfectly beat by simply hack-n-slashing, but it encourages you to try your available resources to make fights much more managable; it treats you as a smart person. And this is something very important that I feel many newcomers ignore which has been applying since their old games. There are always many ways to make fights easier, or even trivialize them. Read your items, use internet tips to help you out, ask friends or summon them to aid you. The game encourages you to do so! ""Easy Mode"" exists but it's not a setting option you can turn on/off; you need to craft it by playing smart.I also want to highlight that Elden Ring is not perfect; a project this large will always have some flaws and there are many things I would've changed. Some examples are: some copypasted minor bosses across dungeons; some QoL improvements; better balancing (especially on the second half of the game)... The point here though is to say it the other way around: it is unbelievable Elden Ring has so few flaws given the scale of the game. With that aside, get ready to explore the (by a LONG shot) best open world map I've ever seen; the most developed combat system and builds (though some of them still unbalanced) FromSoft has ever tried; some of the best boss fights they've made; an staggering amount of content, incredible areas, and interesting characters. This is a new standard on this industry and hopefully the rest of the companies will study and learn the success of this game.As for now, just buy the most worthy $60 title there currently is and hopefully you will feeling the same as me: one of the greatest games I've ever played and the most magical experience I've had in so many years.",isnt much new add game point ill tri fail concis hard hype ive game past year immesurablear soul veteran welcom best soul long shot like alway heart complet surreal amount joy entertain wow moment like first time reach anor londo drangleic castl irithyl game everi minut liter pick everyth like previou titl elden ring easili improvedar new soul seri welcom modern game experi life first time ever product overhyp develop met expect somehow exceed elden ring culmin everyth fromsoft learn past year put togeth first open world game experi freedom mysteri danger absurd amount content vari environ savag attent detail overal one beauti dens open world market offerif feel intimid difficult tag preced fromsoft titl let tell elden ring access game access dont mean easiest forc stomp areaboss previou game open world feel stuck turn around keep explor get stronger boi content explor unlik gener big titl dont go full unga unga game perfectli beat simpli hacknslash encourag tri avail resourc make fight much manag treat smart person someth import feel mani newcom ignor appli sinc old game alway mani way make fight easier even trivial read item use internet tip help ask friend summon aid game encourag easi mode exist set option turn onoff need craft play smarti also want highlight elden ring perfect project larg alway flaw mani thing wouldv chang exampl copypast minor boss across dungeon qol improv better balanc especi second half game point though say way around unbeliev elden ring flaw given scale game asid get readi explor long shot best open world map ive ever seen develop combat system build though still unbalanc fromsoft ever tri best boss fight theyv made stagger amount content incred area interest charact new standard industri hope rest compani studi learn success gamea buy worthi titl current hope feel one greatest game ive ever play magic experi ive mani year
"2017 So, where do I even start?First of all the problem is same with other valve's multiplayer games *cough Dota2 *coughInstead of fixing the game to make it more fun, they're adding more cosmetic items & more esportsWhich is clearly making more money for themThe thing is while they're making more and more money, they don't have enough supports & employees to handle our problemsSo, where did the money go to? I don't know probably more cosmeticsLet's say it like this""Hey which one do you want? New gamemode like chicken defusal mode? Less lag?New weapons, anti hacker weapon? De_Dust that more dustier than before?""""Nah, I think they want more cosmetics. Maybe tattoos? Custom underwear?

"2022 This game needs a lot of work in order for me to recommend it. The AI is annoying to play against on the battlefield, the settlements battles are annoying, especially the minor settlement battles. In my time playing this game I cannot bring myself to play past turn 100, I'll have been annoyed to death from the way the AI behaves in battles or bored over how the AI never seems to be able to build itself up to be a decent threat against me. ""End-game crises"" is the way that CA wants to address this issue I think. But I find that goes against the sandbox nature of the game, I don't want a magical switch to be flipped and have to deal with Mega-Armies with no upkeep for the AI to throw against me. I want an AI that is competent enough to build itself up to present a good threat against me. The crises are boring, an AI that is all natural and grown in the wild is fun and engaging.In the end, I don't want to fight the battles because the AI tries to Lord snipe you whenever possible. The AI dodging artillery attacks was cool the first time I saw it, but after playing for 100 or so hours on IE I find it to be just annoying to watch the amount of dancing and dodging the AI does. Just fight me, just fight me man, I just want fun. Unit mass changes are annoying to me as well, cavalry peeling doesn't feel as good. I find that because of the pressure of making sure my lords don't melt to other AI shenanigans that I can't keep up with the other micro that is expected of certain army compositions. This leads me to just spam low effort cheap units to fight my battles, and it works. Lvl 1 kossar units for kislev can carry your entire campaign, you just have to fight your battles. My list of grudges can go on but I will stop here.In the end, I uninstalled after realizing I wasn't having fun. I was just doing micro dances with the AI instead of having the fun and engaging battles like I had in Warhammer 2. I can't bring myself to play this game anymore. It is annoyance and chore rather than fun.

Simply because the open world design really improves the formula. If you're frustrated or stuck on a boss, go somewhere else. There is a ton to explore. Co op is great fun once you get used to how it works. Unfortunately, the servers aren't very stable and it can sometimes be laggy or disconnect.Even with these rough edges, the game is going to go down in history as one of the greatest RPGs.

If you are a 40k fan and even if you are not this is an amazing game to jump into the series with. It really fulfills the space marine power fantasy as you cut and tear through hordes of Tyranids using all of the different weapons available. The game gets even more fun when playing with friends or matchmaking with randoms. The game is very well made apart from a few mechanics that need some tweaking but I am sure that will be fixed in due time. Cant wait to see what they have in store for this game in terms of new enemies and missions.,fan even amaz game jump seri realli fulfil space marin power fantasi cut tear hord tyranid use differ weapon avail game get even fun play friend matchmak random game well made apart mechan need tweak sure fix due time cant wait see store game term new enemi mission

"I want to recommend this game, I really do. But this is not an $80 game. Campaign took 5 hours, good story. Gameplay feels good, graphics are great. PvE is garbage right now, servers crap out on you. Just spent almost 2 hours trying to queue for a match and every time I got in it would disconnect me. I only made it into an actual game once, I killed two Rubric Marines and then was disconnected. PvP doesn't appeal to me so I haven't tried that, and likely won't.I want more value from an $80 game than a 5hr campaign and a multiplayer that doesn't work. And they want seasons on top of that, slowly trickle out content that might have made this an $80 game over the next few years. If you can pick this up for half price or lower then you should grab this game, or maybe wait a year or two for the content to catch up to the price.",want recommend game realli game campaign took hour good stori gameplay feel good graphic great pve garbag right server crap spent almost hour tri queue match everi time got would disconnect made actual game kill two rubric marin disconnect pvp doesnt appeal havent tri like wonti want valu game campaign multiplay doesnt work want season top slowli trickl content might made game next year pick half price lower grab game mayb wait year two content catch price

"This game has to be one of the worst chinese games to ever release in the west. The game feels so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shallow. There is no depth to anything except 40 million tooltips and infinite things you have to craft to make one thing. The game truly feels like an unfinished mod for PUBG. Do not play it. The game feels very catered towards the chinese market, and even one of my chinese friends say they get better games than this. All of those videos youve seen telling you the game is awesome have been sponsored and paid for by the devs. They are lying. There is no immersion. There is no challenge.

"2022 TLDR: Don't buy. Lots of bugs that CA seem reluctant to fix. Plus pricing is a problem. Original review posted July 2022, see bottom of review:So its been almost a year since I wrote my short review. To answer any questions about performance, it has improved greatly, it's still not the best but it is miles better than it was for me at least.As for pricing I stand with the larger community. CA have tried to push a price hike to make up for their predicted losses whilst their other projects are in the works. That's not the communities issue and should not be expected to cover that predicted loss.IS THE GAME WORTH BUYING?? In short I feel it is not. TWW2 is a better game with far more polish at this time. Buy that and any DLC at a key site/on sale and you'll have a blast.Furthermore there has been very little in terms of bug fixing, including a long list of issues that really break any positives I could raise in this review. The following is a comment from the TW subreddit listing a few of the major issues that Dev leads seem to not be willing to fix a year after they were reported:""For me it feels pointless to even consider purchasing DLC when the base game is in a state like this.Most of these have been reported countless times and are often marked as a ""Known Issue"" for many months.To spread awareness in the playerbase/customerbase of the critical/core long-standing bugs & issues in Tww3, here are the ones I know of:-Campaign map AI utterly sucks, unable to put up a proper fight, build/upgrade up its armies or effectively develop its empires.-Diplomacy mechanics and diplomacy AI in all ways & forms is beyond awful, especially around vassals and alliances-AI is bugged/limited in its perception of nearby faction (AI is literally not aware what factions are nearby [no diplomatic contact]).-Unit pathing in manual battles, especially cities with construct-able barricades, is awful-Units refusing to path through broken city gates & destroyed city walls, instead insisting on using ladders to slowly climb up & exhaust themselves.-Cavalry/monsters getting models stuck, which pulls back the whole unit into death.-Units dropping/forgetting orders, even in the middle of pitched melee combat-Units not shooting because they are ""moving fast"" while being stationary-Units unable to shoot despite having clear Line Of Sight-Battle maps being broken for pathing and LOSight, especially on top of wall crenelations-Auto-resolve insists on damaging & killing Single-entity-monsters and especially artillery pieces, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy 5 to 1.-Auto-resolve still gives cities a ridiculous advantage, even when the player army outnumbers the enemy minor settlement garrison 5 to 1.-Certain units & lords/heroes fail to properly do their charging attack-Units (especially large ones) will randomly die when attacking certain walls/gates or being remotely in proximity of a collapsing wall (but nowhere near close enough for it to be a valid danger).-Units (even lords on foot) will randomly die when climbing ladders.-Some lords (Cathay dragons especially) just flat out fail to perform melee attacks for well over 10 seconds at a time.-AI does not understand nor properly react during the defence of siege battles, it will spread out its army across the map and be unable to fight a concentrated force.-AI charging his fastest units at the start of battle into certain death, especially lords/heroes like Belakor-AI clueless about properly using AOE magic & magic in general, which also makes anything ""anti magic"" rather useless-Hundreds of bugs related to skills, techs, items, unit abilities/stats, building mechanics etc etc.-Sometimes two characters (lords/heroes) will be placed on the exact same coordinates on the campaign map, permanently preventing them from movement and interaction.-Item qualities being nonsense, with common ones often being better than rare/special ones.-Lord/Hero traits either not working or straight up inferior compared to other available ones.-WOChaos revive Norsca faction mechanic intentionally broken by CA because they could not be bothered to properly fix it.-Manual battle AI will sometimes simply not activate, instead its units refuse to attack/defend/move. Seen most often in ambush battles and wood elf forest defensive battles.-Countless quests for lord items or unlocking special lords/heroes do not work properly-AI occasionally able to see your ambush/hidden armies from across immense distances & react to their positioning.-Skirmish mode on ranged units often failing to trigger/react, causing the ranged unit to just stand still-AI will often prioritize targeting, sabotaging or annoying the player even if it means certain doom for its faction.-Player units are utterly unable to finish off a broken leadership/fleeing unit, especially if it is a single entity like a foot lord.-Squads of large-sized ranged units (like salamander/razordon hunting packs) after finishing a move order will take forever to ""wiggle around"" before actually firing-Confederated lords for factions that have loyalty mechanics (skaven etc) will often start at zero loyalty.-Confederated lords will sometimes not be able to change their mounts.-Confederated Legendary lords will sometimes lack their immortality trait, meaning their next death is permanent.-Completely non-functional mechanic for automatic development of cities (everyone forgot this even exists in game because it never worked)-AI lacking any proper skill builds for most lords and heroes, which both makes them weaker and makes those lords useless for confederation.-Bugs related to construct-able objects on defensive maps, where units get stuck in barricades or cannot attack them-Fresh bugs like Bretonia damsels, wood elf ariel, Nakai unit recruitment etc etc.-Black Ark unique map army spawn positions AGAIN bugged, after it was fixed in late TWWH 2-Black Ark capability to offer recruitment to nearby Dark Elf armies bugs out when the Black Ark is garrisoned in a city.-AI will readily kill its own armies by trying to occupy ruins that have just been destroyed by extremely unfriendly (but not yet at war) factions which are still surrounding that location (from the previous turns razing).-AI will readily abandon its capital city and flee to some meaningless tier 1 settlement when facing an equal force (instead of fighting where its chance is best, inside the capitol).-Some sea objects (like islands/treasure/skull/carcass) will cause a guaranteed crash to desktop-AI will insist on besieging a weak settlement for 10 turns despite outnumbering & overpowering the garrison 5 to 1, and auto-resolve showing certain defeat for the players city.-Various lord/hero equip-able ancillaries that fail to work properly-Vampire Count/Coast UI for showing raise dead pool possibilities (near city bar UI) does not show units recruit-able from battle casualties.-Certain unique Cathay Caravan rewards are again inaccessible, despite being ""fixed"" in some previous patch (such as the vampire weapon).-There is a limited number of names for generic lords/heroes, and once they have all been used up the game notifications will start showing nonsense (mixing up factions, names & icons etc).""20 mins played with very poor performance. It's difficult to understand why they made changes to the engine when WH2 looked great. 3080ti and 7900k for reference. It's a shame because the game is unplayable on the campaign map with less than 10fps unless I am zoomed right in. FYI I did not pay full price for the game.

The world really opened up for me after I went to Meyer's Market. After that I started seeing what the game really had to offer. Fun bosses with equally fun designs, locations and quests. Deviants with their own personalities and environmental details that encourage and reward exploration. It's not perfect. Voice acting is incomplete (or there's a bug that mutes it). I have no idea why I should bother with Eternaland. Some processes are unnecessarily complicated.

Nothing inherently wrong with that, but it was done in the worst way possible.Also, I love when games randomly spend almost 10 minutes dumping copious amounts of dialogue and verbiage on you to try and make any sense of what is happening.",seem like amalgam content recent success game ie death strand rust fortnit even palworldpokemon noth inher wrong done worst way possiblealso love game randomli spend almost minut dump copiou amount dialogu verbiag tri make sens happen
"2023 I've bought every DLC from WH1 to WH3, with the exception of your newest 25$ DLC pack.For that price I'd expect a new, fully fleshed out faction. What do we get? 3 Legendary Lords and a unit roster that does very little to pad out the existing races you chose to feature in that DLC pack. You lot must be really getting ribbed hard by your investors to destroy all the good faith you've built with your community these long, long years. I waited patiently for WH3. I waited patiently for the DLCs to release -- because I thought it would get to a standard that would match WH2. I was wrong.Warhammer 3 was supposed to be your magnum opus. The king of kings. CA, you can still fix this. Your management just need to pull their heads out of your investor's buttholes and actually support your developers on this project. Help them help you. If you lot screw this game up more than you have, there will be no relevancy left for you. You think anyone will buy anything from you goobers again if you let this beautiful idea fail from mismanagement? Respect our time, respect our money. Inflation has hit everyone. Products are shrinking in size everywhere, prices are going up across the board. I refuse to believe inflation has hit a game company as hard as it has the rest of us. Maybe in your bottom line in the fact you actually have to pay your employees, CA. But I doubt they hardly see any of the benefits of your increased prices, hence - I don't give a damn about any PR speech related to your hardships. Your workers don't get any extra pay, only your crappy management do. I bet your management aren't even game developers. I bet they're just scum sucking bean counters who wormed their way up in the game industry through their sales experience. Guess what, people want a good game. Just give them one and they'll pay. These bad reviews aren't just because of your awful, awful DLC. The game itself is not in a good state. Promises that were made have been under-delivered. There has been an extremely long gap between DLC and updates. People have expectations, hopes - and those two things can only be betrayed so many times.Then you give them Shadows of Change? More like Shadows of the Underwhelmed. There's only one way to teach a bean counter how to invest in a good game. Make bad game. Numbers go down. No need for any of us to invest our time and money in disappointment.Make a good game, numbers go up. I know investors are like children in that they're used to instant gratification. But maybe they can learn how to wait like the rest of us are forced to? At least they wont be disappointed by the cold hard cash you dummies will make if you actually pull WH3 off right. It'll take time. Just show the community good faith, transparency and a willingness to veer back onto the right track. Prices to match the content provided, bullcrap about 'inflation' aside. 3 LLs and some units meant to slightly pad out some base game faction niches? 14.99$.Hey you know what I'll even be generous and offer some solutions, it'll make your desk jockeys heads spin.Change your Shadows of Change DLC to 14.99$ and offer those who've bought the DLC a discount on the next content pack you decide to release, equal to the 10$ they have lost. I mean, it's practically ensuring returning customers!!! If you can't do that? Offer them all exclusive beta access to your next content pack for testing/enjoyment. Wow, a band-aid and it's practically free. All you'd have to do after that is fix/tweak what's already there in between your DLC projects. Maybe fix some bugs and features you promised.I know, I'm a genius.

"Score: 8.5/10Story:What more can be said? The narrative is rooted in a true literary masterpiece. There are some interpretations that I find intriguing and aligned with the overall message the game seeks to convey, though I might have differing views on certain aspects of how they twisted the original story. However, that's purely subjective and doesn't detract from the quality of the story.Visuals and Design:I absolutely love the landscapes, character designs, and costumes. As someone who grew up reading Journey to the West, seeing the novel's mythical creatures brought to life in the game is an exhilarating experience. The environments are breathtaking and immersive, with the grand Buddha statues and some architectural elements leaving a profound impact on me. The game features some of the most stunning scenery I've ever encountered, and they all feel authentically reminiscent of places I’ve actually seen. It’s simply marvelous.Boss Design:The boss designs are quite impressive, with some moves that are visually striking and others that are distinctly unique. What sets them apart is that, they defy conventional tropes and offer a refreshing experience. This uniqueness is a credit to the original author of the novel and the ancient Chinese folklore he drew upon.I really like some of the bosses, but I can’t go into details since I want to avoid spoilers.Combat System:The combat animations are cool, and the spells are visually captivating, especially because I’m a huge fan of Wukong. The way the spells are represented aligns well with my expectations.However, this is where my main critique lies. I prefer engaging in combat by directly confronting enemies rather than relying heavily on dodging and waiting for an opening to strike, as in Souls-like games. This game isn’t a Souls-like, or at least it attempts to incorporate more character abilities, primarily through spell. In my opinion, the key distinction between action games and Souls-like games lies in how players can influence enemy behavior. Action games allow for interruptions, counters, and disruptions, rewarding players for such high-risk maneuvers with a strong sense of satisfaction.In this game, the Monkey can interrupt or parry enemies, but it’s done through heavy after light attack or spells rather than the core combat system. This, to me, is the biggest issue: it lacks a dedicated blocking or counter system, placing too much emphasis on dodging. Parrying with heavy is a nice idea to bring the fluidity into the combat but in quite a lot time you just fail. Also there are a lot of attacks which cannot be parry and the only option is to dodge, or use magic. This results in less interactive combat, which diminishes the overall experience. (In my opinion Ghost of Tsushima had excellent interactivity, though I understand it’s a different scenario with mostly human bosses in a low-magic setting.)Overall, I feel that while the heavy parry derived from the staff techniques and the spell abilities are intriguing, they fall short in delivering the level of interactivity needed to make the combat feel rewarding. Once the novelty wears off, the battles can feel somewhat monotonous.Map:The map is decent. Personally, I don't have a strong opinion on invisible walls, though I understand why others might find them frustrating. What I do wish for is a mini-map because I often struggle with navigation. Relying on online guides to find my way slightly detracts from the overall experience.Chapters:The game boasts one of the coolest and most epic prologues I've ever seen, delivering a significant impact. The first four chapters are solid, offering plenty of content and expansive maps. However, chapters five and six feel a bit rushed and could have been more fleshed out.The side quests are not very clear and you could miss them.",score said narr root true literari masterpiec interpret find intrigu align overal messag game seek convey though might differ view certain aspect twist origin stori howev that pure subject doesnt detract qualiti storyvisu designi absolut love landscap charact design costum someon grew read journey west see novel mythic creatur brought life game exhilar experi environ breathtak immers grand buddha statu architectur element leav profound impact game featur stun sceneri ive ever encount feel authent reminisc place ive actual seen simpli marvelousboss designth boss design quit impress move visual strike other distinctli uniqu set apart defi convent trope offer refresh experi uniqu credit origin author novel ancient chines folklor drew uponi realli like boss cant go detail sinc want avoid spoilerscombat systemth combat anim cool spell visual captiv especi im huge fan wukong way spell repres align well expectationshowev main critiqu lie prefer engag combat directli confront enemi rather reli heavili dodg wait open strike soulslik game game isnt soulslik least attempt incorpor charact abil primarili spell opinion key distinct action game soulslik game lie player influenc enemi behavior action game allow interrupt counter disrupt reward player highrisk maneuv strong sens satisfactionin game monkey interrupt parri enemi done heavi light attack spell rather core combat system biggest issu lack dedic block counter system place much emphasi dodg parri heavi nice idea bring fluiditi combat quit lot time fail also lot attack parri option dodg use magic result less interact combat diminish overal experi opinion ghost tsushima excel interact though understand differ scenario mostli human boss lowmag settingoveral feel heavi parri deriv staff techniqu spell abil intrigu fall short deliv level interact need make combat feel reward novelti wear battl feel somewhat monotonousmapth map decent person dont strong opinion invis wall though understand other might find frustrat wish minimap often struggl navig reli onlin guid find way slightli detract overal experiencechaptersth game boast one coolest epic prologu ive ever seen deliv signific impact first four chapter solid offer plenti content expans map howev chapter five six feel bit rush could flesh outth side quest clear could miss
